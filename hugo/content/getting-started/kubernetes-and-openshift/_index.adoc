Latest Release: 2.1.0 {docdate}

== Getting Started

{{% notice tip %}}
The examples located in the *kube* directory work on both Kubernetes and OpenShift. Ensure the `CCP_CLI` environment variable
is set to the correct binary for your environment.
{{% /notice %}}

Set the environment variable in `.bashrc` to ensure the examples will work in your environment.
....
# Kubernetes
export CCP_CLI=kubectl

# OpenShift
export CCP_CLI=oc
....

Here are some useful resources for finding the right commands to troubleshoot & modify containers in
the various environments shown in this guide:

* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-cheatsheet/[Kubectl Cheat Sheet]
* link:https://github.com/nekop/openshift-sandbox/blob/master/docs/command-cheatsheet.md[OpenShift Cheat Sheet]
* link:https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/using_helm.md[Helm Cheat Sheet]

== Example Conventions

The examples provided in Container Suite are simple examples that
are meant to demonstrate key Container Suite features.  These
examples can be used to build more production level deployments
as dictated by user requirements specific to their operating
environments.

The examples generally follow these conventions:

 * There is a *run.sh* script that you will execute to start the example.
 * There is a *cleanup.sh* script that you will execute to shutdown and cleanup the example.
 * Each example will create resources such as Secrets, ConfigMaps, Services, and PersistentVolumeClaims, all which follow a naming convention of *<example name>-<optional description suffix>*. For example an example called *primary* might have a PersistentVolumeClaim called *primary-pgconf* to describe the purpose of that particular PVC.
 * The folder names for each example give a clue as to which Container Suite feature it demonstrates. For instance, the *examples/kube/pgaudit* example demonstrates how to enable the pg_audit capability of the crunchy-postgres container.

== Administration

=== Password Management

The passwords used for the PostgreSQL user accounts are generated
by the OpenShift `process` command.  To inspect what value is
supplied, you can inspect the primary pod as follows:

....
${CCP_CLI} get pod pr-primary -o json | grep -C 1 'PG_USER\|PG_PASSWORD\|PG_DATABASE'
....

This will give you the environment variable values for the database created by default
in addition to the username and password of the standard user.

 *  `PG_USER`
 *  `PG_PASSWORD`
 *  `PG_DATABASE`

=== Kubernetes Secrets

You can use Kubernetes Secrets to set and maintain your database
credentials.  Secrets requires you base64 encode your user and password
values as follows:
....
echo -n 'myuserid' | base64
....

You will paste these values into  your JSON secrets files for values.

This example allows you to set the PostgreSQL passwords
using Kubernetes Secrets.

The secret uses a base64 encoded string to represent the
values to be read by the container during initialization.  The
encoded password value is *password*.  Run the example
as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/secret
./run.sh
....

The secrets are mounted in the `/pguser`, `/pgprimary`, and `/pgroot` volumes within the
container and read during initialization.  The container
scripts create a PostgreSQL user with those values, and sets the passwords
for the primary user and PostgreSQL superuser using the mounted secret volumes.

When using secrets, you do *NOT* have to specify the following
environment variables if you specify all three secrets volumes:

 * `PG_USER`
 * `PG_PASSWORD`
 * `PG_ROOT_PASSWORD`
 * `PG_PRIMARY_USER`
 * `PG_PRIMARY_PASSWORD`

You can test the container as follows. In all cases, the password is *password*:
....
psql -h secret -U pguser1 postgres
psql -h secret -U postgres postgres
psql -h secret -U primaryuser postgres
....

=== pgAdmin4

This example deploys the pgadmin4 v2 web user interface
for PostgreSQL without TLS.

After running the example, you should be able to browse to http://127.0.0.1:5050
and log into the web application with the following configured credentials:

 * Username : *admin@admin.com*
 * Password: *password*

If you are running this example using Kubernetes or
OpenShift, it is required to use a port-forward proxy to access the dashboard.

To start the port-forward proxy run the following:

....
${CCP_CLI} port-forward pgadmin4-http 5050:5050
....

To access the pgAdmin4 dashboard through the proxy, navigate to *http://127.0.0.1:5050*
in a browser.

See the link:http://pgadmin.org[pgAdmin4 documentation] for more details.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To run this example, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgadmin4-http
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start the container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgadmin4-http
./run.sh
....

{{% notice tip %}}
An emptyDir with write access must be mounted to the `/run/httpd` directory in OpenShift.
{{% /notice %}}

=== pgAdmin4 with TLS

This example deploys the pgadmin4 v2 web user interface
for PostgreSQL with TLS.

After running the example, you should be able to browse to https://127.0.0.1:5050
and log into the web application with the following configured credentials:

 * Username : *admin@admin.com*
 * Password: *password*

If you are running this example using Kubernetes or
OpenShift, it is required to use a port-forward proxy to access the dashboard.

To start the port-forward proxy run the following:

....
${CCP_CLI} port-forward pgadmin4-https 5050:5050
....

To access the pgAdmin4 dashboard through the proxy, navigate to *https://127.0.0.1:5050*
in a browser.

See the link:http://pgadmin.org[pgadmin4 documentation] for more details.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To run this example, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgadmin4-https
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start the container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgadmin4-https
./run.sh
....

{{% notice tip %}}
An emptyDir with write access must be mounted to the `/run/httpd` directory in OpenShift.
{{% /notice %}}

=== Upgrade

{{% notice tip %}}
This example assumes you have run *primary* using a PG 9.5 or 9.6 image
such as `centos7-9.5.14-2.1.0` prior to running this upgrade.
{{% /notice %}}

Starting in release 1.3.1, the upgrade container will let
you perform a `pg_upgrade` either from a PostgreSQL version 9.5 database to
9.6 or from 9.6 to 10.

Prior to running this example, make sure your `CCP_IMAGE_TAG`
environment variable is using the next major version of PostgreSQL that you
want to upgrade to. For example, if you're upgrading from 9.5 to 9.6, make
sure the variable references a PG 9.6 image such as `centos7-9.6.10-2.1.0`.

This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:

 * a Kubernetes Job running the *crunchy-upgrade* container
 * a new data directory name *upgrade* found in the *pgnewdata* PVC

{{% notice tip %}}
Data checksums on the Crunchy PostgreSQL container were enabled by default in version 2.1.0.
When trying to upgrade, it's required that both the old database and the new database
have the same data checksums setting.  Prior to upgrade, check if `data_checksums`
were enabled on the database by running the following SQL: `SHOW data_checksums`
{{% /notice %}}

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

{{% notice tip %}}
Before running the example, ensure you edit `upgrade.json` and update the `OLD_VERSION`
and `NEW_VERSION` parameters to the ones relevant to your situation.
{{% /notice %}}

Start the upgrade as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/upgrade
./run.sh
....

If successful, the Job will end with a **successful** status. Verify
the results of the Job by examining the Job's pod log:
....
${CCP_CLI} get pod -l job-name=upgrade
${CCP_CLI} logs -l job-name=upgrade
....

You can verify the upgraded database by running the `post-upgrade.sh` script in the
`examples/kube/upgrade` directory.  This will create a PostgreSQL pod that mounts the
upgraded volume.

=== Cron Scheduler

The crunchy-dba container implements a cron scheduler. The purpose of the crunchy-dba
container is to offer a way to perform simple DBA tasks that occur on some form of
schedule such as backup jobs or running a vacuum on a single PostgreSQL database container
(such as the *primary* example).

You can either run the crunchy-dba container as a single pod or include the container
within a database pod.

The crunchy-dba container makes use of a Service Account to perform the startup of
scheduled jobs. The Kubernetes Job type is used to execute the scheduled jobs with a Restart
policy of Never.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

The script to schedule vacuum on a regular schedule is executed through the following
commands:
....
# Kubernetes
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba
./run-kube-vac.sh

# OpenShift
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba
./run-ocp-vac.sh
....

To run the script for scheduled backups, run the following in the same directory:
....
# Kubernetes
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba
./run-kube-backup.sh

# OpenShift
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba
./run-ocp-backup.sh
....

Individual parameters for both can be modified within their respective JSON files;
please see the link:/container-specifications/[Container Specifications] document for a full list of what can be modified.

=== Vacuum

You can perform a PostgreSQL vacuum command by running the crunchy-vacuum
container. You specify a database to vacuum using environment variables. By default,
vacuum is executed against the *primary* example container.

The crunchy-vacuum container image exists to allow a DBA a way to run a job either
individually or scheduled to perform a variety of vacuum operations.

This example performs a vacuum on a single table in the primary PostgreSQL
database. The crunchy-vacuum image is executed with the PostgreSQL connection
parameters to the single-primary PostgreSQL container.  The type of vacuum performed is
dictated by the environment variables passed into the job; these are defined with further detail
link:/container-specifications/crunchy-vacuum[here].

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Run the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/vacuum
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/vacuum/
./run.sh
....

Verify the job is completed:
....
${CCP_CLI} get job
....

=== systemd

The crunchy-pg.service is an example of a systemd unit file
that starts and stops a container named crunchy-pg that
has already been created.

The example scripts are located in the following directory:
....
$CCPROOT/examples/systemd/
....

There are two scripts within the directory.

....
test-start.sh
....

This script is called by the systemd start execution.  The trick
with this script is that it blocks forever after starting the
docker crunchy-pg container. The blocking in the script
keeps systemd happy and thinking that this is a normal daemon.

....
test-stop.sh
....

This script stops the test-start.sh script and also stops the
crunchy-pg Docker container.

== Backup and Restoration

=== pg_dump

The script assumes you are going to backup the *primary* example and that container
is running.

This example assumes you have configured a storage filesystem as described
in the link:/installation/storage-configuration/[Storage Configuration] document.

A successful backup will perform pg_dump/pg_dumpall on the primary and store
the resulting files in the mounted volume under a directory named `<HOSTNAME>-backups`
as a sub-directory, then followed by a unique backup directory based upon a
date and timestamp - allowing any number of backups to be kept.

For more information on how to configure this container, please see the link:/container-specifications/[Container Specifications] document.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Run the backup with this command:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgdump
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgdump
./run.sh
....

The Kubernetes Job type executes a pod and then the pod exits.  You can
view the Job status using this command:
....
${CCP_CLI} get job
....

The `pgdump.json` file within that directory specifies options that control the behavior of the pgdump job.
Examples of this include whether to run pg_dump vs pg_dumpall and advanced options for specific backup use cases.

=== pg_restore

The script assumes you are going to restore to the *primary* example and that container
is running and a backup has been created using the `pgdump` example..

This example assumes you have configured a storage filesystem as described
in the link:/installation/storage-configuration/[Storage Configuration] document.

Successful use of the `crunchy-pgrestore` container will run a job to restore files generated by
pg_dump/pg_dumpall to a container via psql/pg_restore; then container will terminate successfully
and signal job completion.

For more information on how to configure this container, please see the link:/container-specifications/[Container Specifications] document.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Run the restore with this command:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgrestore
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

By default, pgrestore container will automatically restore from the most recent backup.
If you want to restore to a specific backup, edit the `pgrestore.json` file and update the
`PGRESTORE_BACKUP_TIMESTAMP` setting to specify the backup path you want to restore with. For example:
....
"name":"PGRESTORE_BACKUP_TIMESTAMP",
"value":"2018-03-27-14-35-33"
....

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgrestore
./run.sh
....

The Kubernetes Job type executes a pod and then the pod exits.  You can
view the Job status using this command:
....
${CCP_CLI} get job
....

The `pgrestore.json` file within that directory specifies options that control the behavior of the pgrestore job.

=== pgBackRest

pgbackrest is a utility that performs a backup, restore, and archive
function for a PostgreSQL database. pgbackrest is written and
maintained by David Steele, and more information can be found on the
link:http://www.pgbackrest.org/[official website].

Backups are currently performed by manually executing pgbackrest commands against the desired pod.
Restores can now be performed via the crunchy-backrest-restore container, which offers FULL or
DELTA restore capability.

pgbackrest is configured using a `pgbackrest.conf` file that is
mounted into the crunchy-postgres container at `/pgconf`.

If you place a `pgbackrest.conf` file within this mounted directory, it
will trigger the use of pgbackrest within the PostgreSQL container
as the `archive_command` and will turn on the `archive_mode` to begin
archival.  It is still required to define the `ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT` environment
variable within your container configuration as it is set to
a disable value of 0 by default.

The following changes will be made to the container's `postgresql.conf`
file:
....
ARCHIVE_MODE=on
ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT=60
ARCHIVE_COMMAND='pgbackrest --stanza=db archive-push %p'
....

If you are using a crunchy-postgres image older than 1.7.1, `archive_command` must specify where
the `pgbackrest.conf` file is located:
....
ARCHIVE_COMMAND='pgbackrest --config=/pgconf/pgbackrest.conf --stanza=db archive-push %p'
....

{{% notice warning %}}
This requires you use a pgbackrest stanza name of *db* within the
`pgbackrest.conf` file you mount.
{{% /notice %}}

When set, WAL files generated by the database will be written
out to the `/backrestrepo/HOSTNAME-backups` mount point.

Additionally, the Crunchy Postgres container can templatize `pgbackrest.conf` files
by searching for the HOSTNAME values in a mounted `pgbackrest.conf` file.

For example, `db-path=/pgdata/HOSTNAME` will render to `db-path=/pgdata/primary` if
the container's hostname is primary.  HOSTNAME will be replaced with the value of
`PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE` when working with deployments/replicasets.

{{% notice warning %}}
The templating example above works for `db-path` settings, however, `repo-path` should
follow the convention `repo-path=/backrestrepo/HOSTNAME-backups` in cases where
volumes are being mounted to a single mount point (such as hostPath or NFS).  Without
the additional `-backups` the backups will populate in the `pgdata` directory.
{{% /notice %}}

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

===== Backup

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/backup
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:

 * configMap containing `pgbackrest.conf`
 * PostgreSQL pod with pgBackRest configured
 * PostgreSQL service
 * PVC for the PGDATA directory
 * PVC for the BackRest Backups and Archives directory

Examine the `/backrestrepo` location to view the archive directory and ensure WAL archiving is working.

You can create a backup using backrest using this command within the container:
....
${CCP_CLI} exec -it backrest /bin/bash
pgbackrest --stanza=db backup --type=full
....

===== Async Archiving

pgBackRest supports asyncronous archiving to pull and push Write Ahead Logs.
Asynchronous operation is more efficient because it can reuse connections and take
advantage of parallelism.  For more information on async archiving, see the pgBackRest
link:https://pgbackrest.org/user-guide.html#async-archiving[official documentation].

This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:

 * configMap containing `pgbackrest.conf`
 * PostgreSQL pod with pgBackRest configured and archiving asynchronously.
 * PostgreSQL service
 * PVC for the PGDATA directory
 * PVC for the BackRest Backups and Archives directory

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/async-archiving
./run.sh
....

Examine the `/backrestrepo/HOSTNAME-backups` location to view the archive directory
and ensure WAL archiving is working.

Examine the `/pgdata/HOSTNAME-spool` location to view the transient directory
used for async archiving.

You can create a backup using backrest using this command within the container:
....
${CCP_CLI} exec -it backrest-async-archive /bin/bash
pgbackrest --stanza=db backup
....

{{% notice warning %}}
A spooling directory is automatically created in both `/pgdata` and `/pgwal`.  It is
advised to configure pgBackRest to use the spooling location closest to the Write Ahead Log.

If the PostgreSQL container was created using the `XLOGDIR` variable, the `/pgwal/HOSTNAME-spool`
directory should be configured in `pgbackrest.conf` as such: `spool-path=/pgwal/HOSTNAME-spool`.
If WAL resides on PGDATA, use: `spool-path=/pgdata/HOSTNAME-spool`
{{% /notice %}}

==== Restore

There are three options to choose from when performing a restore:

 * Delta - only restore missing files from PGDATA
 * Full - restore all files, pgdata must be empty
 * Point in Time Recovery (PITR) - delta restore to a certain point in time

===== PITR

{{% notice tip %}}
This example uses the `backrest/backup` example.  It should be left running and a
pgBackRest backup has been created.
{{% /notice %}}

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/pitr
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:

 * configMap containing `pgbackrest.conf`
 * Backrest-Restore pod with pgBackRest configured for PITR restore

pgBackRest will restore the `pgdata` volume mounted to the restore container
to the point in time specified by the `PITR_TARGET` environment variable.  To get
a compliant timestamp, PostgreSQL can be queried using the following SQL:

....
psql -U postgres -Atc 'select current_timestamp'
....

After a successful restore, run the following to start the restored PostgreSQL container:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/pitr
./post-restore.sh
....

=== pgBackRest with SSHD

The PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL GIS containers can enable an SSH daemon to allow developers
to do DBA tasks on the database server without the need for exec privileges.  An administrator
who deploys the SSHD enabled PostgreSQL database can specify the authorized public keys for
access to the database server.

In order to activate SSHD in the PostgreSQL containers, the following files need to be
mounted to the PostgreSQL container:

- SSH Host keys mounted on the /sshd volume. Three keys are required:

  * ssh_host_rsa_key
  * ssh_host_ecdsa_key
  * ssh_host_ed25519_key

- sshd_config mounted on the /pgconf volume
- authorized_keys mounted on the /pgconf volume

SSHD can be enabled in the PostgreSQL containers by adding the following line:
....
ENABLE_SSHD=true
....

The *authorized_keys* file is mounted on the */pgconf* directory.  In order to support
using this mount for authentication the following must be set in *sshd_config*:
....
AuthorizedKeysFile /pgconf/authorized_keys
StrictModes no
....

For OpenShift deployments, the following configuration needs to be set in *sshd_config*:
....
UsePAM no
....

==== Docker

Start the example as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/postgres-sshd
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Docker environment:

 * A volume named pgconf which contains the pgbackrest.conf, pg_hba.conf, postgresql.conf, sshd_config, authorized_keys file
 * A volume named sshd containing the SSH Host keys
 * postgres-sshd container pgbackrest archive and sshd enabled. An initial stanza db will be created on initialization

After running the example, SSH to the container using the forwarded port 2022:

....
ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@0.0.0.0
....

==== Kubernetes / OpenShift

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/postgres-sshd
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:

 * A configMap named pgconf which contains the pgbackrest.conf, pg_hba.conf, postgresql.conf, sshd_config, authorized_keys file
 * A secret named sshd-secrets containing the SSH Host keys
 * postgres-sshd pod with pgbackrest archive and sshd enabled. An initial stanza db will be created on initialization
 * postgres-sshd service with port 2022 for SSH

After running the example, SSH to the service using the postgres-sshd service available in Kubernetes:

....
ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@postgres-sshd
....

==== Using pgBackrest via SSH

If a pgbackrest.conf file is located on the /pgconf volume and archiving is enabled, it's possible to
run backups using the pgBackrest utility.

With the SSHD service running, the following command will issue a pgBackrest backup.
....
ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@postgres-sshd pgbackrest --stanza=db backup
....

To list all the available pgBackrest backups, run the following:
....
ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@postgres-sshd pgbackrest info

=== pg_basebackup

The script assumes you are going to backup the *primary*
container created in the first example, so you need to ensure
that container is running. This example assumes you have configured storage as described
in the link:/installation/storage-configuration/[Storage Configuration documentation]. Things to point out with this example
include its use of persistent volumes and volume claims to store the backup data files.

A successful backup will perform `pg_basebackup` on the *primary* container and store
the backup in the `$CCP_STORAGE_PATH` volume under a directory named `primary-backups`. Each
backup will be stored in a subdirectory with a timestamp as the name, allowing any number of backups to be kept.

The backup script will do the following:

* Start up a backup container named backup
* Run `pg_basebackup` on the container named *primary*
* Store the backup in the `/tmp/backups/primary-backups` directory
* Exit after the backup

When you are ready to restore from the backup, the restore example runs a PostgreSQL container
using the backup location. Upon initialization, the container will use rsync to copy the backup
data to this new container and then launch PostgreSQL using the original backed-up data.

The restore script will do the following:

* Start up a container named *restore*
* Copy the backup files from the previous backup example into `/pgdata`
* Start up the container using the backup files
* Map the PostgreSQL port of 5432 in the container to your local host port of 12001

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Run the backup with this command:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backup
./run.sh
....

When you're ready to restore, a *restore* example is provided.

It's required to specified a backup path for this example.  To get the correct path
check the `backup` job logs or a timestamp:

....
docker logs backup-vpk9l | grep BACKUP_PATH
Wed May  9 20:32:00 UTC 2018 INFO: BACKUP_PATH is set to /pgdata/primary-backups/2018-05-09-20-32-00.
....

BACKUP_PATH can also be discovered by looking at the backup mount directly (if access
to the storage is available to the user).

An example of BACKUP_PATH is as followed:
....
"name": "BACKUP_PATH",
"value": "primary-backups/2018-05-09-20-32-00"
....

When you are ready to restore from the backup created, run the following example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/restore
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backup
./run.sh
....

The Kubernetes Job type executes a pod and then the pod exits.  You can
view the Job status using this command:
....
${CCP_CLI} get job
....

When you're ready to restore, a *restore* example is provided.

It's required to specified a backup path for this example.  To get the correct path
check the `backup` job logs or a timestamp:
....
kubectl logs backup-vpk9l | grep BACKUP_PATH
Wed May  9 20:32:00 UTC 2018 INFO: BACKUP_PATH is set to /pgdata/primary-backups/2018-05-09-20-32-00.
....

BACKUP_PATH can also be discovered by looking at the backup mount directly (if access
to the storage is available to the user).

An example of BACKUP_PATH defined as a variable within the JSON script is as follows:
....
"name": "BACKUP_PATH",
"value": "primary-backups/2018-05-09-20-32-00"
....

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/restore
./run.sh
....

Test the restored database as follows:
....
psql -h restore -U postgres postgres
....

=== Point in Time Recovery (PITR)

PITR (point-in-time-recovery) is a feature that allows for recreating a database
from backup and log files at a certain point in time. This is done using a write
ahead log (WAL) which is kept in the `pg_wal` directory within `PGDATA`. Changes
made to the database files over time are recorded in these log files, which allows
it to be used for disaster recovery purposes.

When using PITR as a backup method, in order to restore from the last checkpoint in
the event of a database or system failure, it is only necessary to save these log
files plus a full backup. This provides an additional advantage in that it is not
necessary to keep multiple full backups on hand, which consume space and time to create.
This is because point in time recovery allows you to "replay" the log files and recover
your database to any point since the last full backup.

More detailed information about Write Ahead Log (WAL) archiving can be found
link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/continuous-archiving.html[here.]

By default in the crunchy-postgres container, WAL logging is *not* enabled.
To enable WAL logging *outside of this example*, set the following environment
variables when starting the crunchy-postgres container:
....
ARCHIVE_MODE=on
ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT=60
....

These variables set the same name settings within the `postgresql.conf`
file that is used by the database. When set, WAL files generated by the database
will be written out to the `/pgwal` mount point.

A full backup is required to do a PITR.  crunchy-backup currently
performs this role within the example, running a `pg_basebackup` on the database.
This is a requirement for PITR. After a backup is performed, code is added into
crunchy-postgres which will also check to see if you want to do a PITR.

There are three volume mounts used with the PITR example.

* `/recover` - When specified within a crunchy-postgres container, PITR is activated during container startup.
* `/backup` - This is used to find the base backup you want to recover from.
* `/pgwal` - This volume is used to write out new WAL files from the newly restored database container.

Some environment variables used to manipulate the point in time recovery logic:

* The `RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME` environment variable is used to tell the PITR logic what the name of the target is.
* `RECOVERY_TARGET_TIME` is also an optional environment variable that restores using a known time stamp.

If you don't specify either of these environment variables, then the PITR logic will assume you want to
restore using all the WAL files or essentially the last known recovery point.

The `RECOVERY_TARGET_INCLUSIVE` environment variable is also available to
let you control the setting of the `recovery.conf` setting `recovery_target_inclusive`.
If you do not set this environment variable the default is *true*.

Once you recover a database using PITR, it will be in read-only mode. To
make the database resume as a writable database, run the following SQL command:
....
postgres=# select pg_wal_replay_resume();
....

{{% notice tip %}}
If you're running the PITR example for *PostgreSQL versions 9.5 or 9.6*, please note that
starting in PostgreSQL version 10, the `pg_xlog` directory was renamed to `pg_wal`. Additionally, all usages
of the function `pg_xlog_replay_resume` were changed to `pg_wal_replay_resume`.
{{% /notice %}}

It takes about 1 minute for the database to become ready for use after initially starting.

{{% notice warning %}}
WAL segment files are written to the */tmp* directory. Leaving the example running
for a long time could fill up your /tmp directory.
{{% /notice %}}

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Create a database container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pitr
./run-pitr.sh
....

Next, we will create a base backup of that database using this:
....
./run-backup-pitr.sh
....

After creating the base backup of the database, WAL segment files are created every 60 seconds
that contain any database changes. These segments are stored in the
`/tmp/pitr/pitr/pg_wal` directory.

Next, create some recovery targets within the database by running
the SQL commands against the *pitr* database as follows:
....
./run-sql.sh
....

This will create recovery targets named `beforechanges`, `afterchanges`, and
`nomorechanges`.  It will create a table, *pitrtest*, between
the `beforechanges` and `afterchanges` targets.  It will also run a SQL
`CHECKPOINT` to flush out the changes to WAL segments. These labels can be
used to mark the points in the recovery process that will be referenced when
creating the restored database.

Next, now that we have a base backup and a set of WAL files containing
our database changes, we can shut down the *pitr* database
to simulate a database failure.  Do this by running the following:
....
docker stop pitr
....

Next, let's edit the restore script to use the base backup files
created in the step above.  You can view the backup path name
under the `/tmp/backups/pitr-backups/` directory. You will see
another directory inside of this path with a name similar to
`2018-03-21-21-03-29`.  Copy and paste that value into the
`run-restore-pitr.sh` script in the `BACKUP` environment variable.

After that, run the script.
....
vi ./run-restore-pitr.sh
./run-restore-pitr.sh
....

The WAL segments are read and applied when restoring from the database
backup.  At this point, you should be able to verify that the
database was restored to the point before creating the test table:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
....

This SQL command should show that the pitrtest table does not exist
at this recovery time. The output should be similar to:
....
ERROR: relation "pitrtest" does not exist
....

PostgreSQL allows you to pause the recovery process if the target name
or time is specified.  This pause would allow a DBA a chance to review
the recovery time/name and see if this is what they want or expect.  If so,
the DBA can run the following command to resume and complete the recovery:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'select pg_wal_replay_resume()'
....

Until you run the statement above, the database will be left in read-only
mode.

Next, run the script to restore the database
to the `afterchanges` restore point. Update the `RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME` to `afterchanges`:
....
vi ./run-restore-pitr.sh
./run-restore-pitr.sh
....

After this restore, you should be able to see the test table:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'select pg_wal_replay_resume()'
....

Lastly, start a recovery using all of the WAL files. This will get the
restored database as current as possible. To do so, edit the script
to remove the `RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME` environment setting completely:
....
./run-restore-pitr.sh
sleep 30
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
....

At this point, you should be able to create new data in the restored database
and the test table should be present.  When you recover the entire
WAL history, resuming the recovery is not necessary to enable writes.

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start by running the example database container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pitr
./run-pitr.sh
....

This step will create a database container, *pitr*.  This
container is configured to continuously write WAL segment files
to a mounted volume (`/pgwal`).

After you start the database, you will create a base backup
using this command:
....
./run-backup-pitr.sh
....

This will create a backup and write the backup files to a persistent
volume (`/pgbackup`).

Next, create some recovery targets within the database by running
the SQL commands against the *pitr* database as follows:
....
./run-sql.sh
....

This will create recovery targets named `beforechanges`, `afterchanges`, and
`nomorechanges`.  It will create a table, *pitrtest*, between
the `beforechanges` and `afterchanges` targets.  It will also run a SQL
`CHECKPOINT` to flush out the changes to WAL segments.

Next, now that we have a base backup and a set of WAL files containing
our database changes, we can shut down the *pitr* database
to simulate a database failure.  Do this by running the following:
....
${CCP_CLI} delete pod pitr
....

Next, we will create 3 different restored database containers based
upon the base backup and the saved WAL files.

First, get the BACKUP_PATH created by the `backup-pitr` example by viewing the pods logs:

....
${CCP_CLI} logs backup-pitr-8sfkh | grep PATH
Thu May 10 18:07:58 UTC 2018 INFO: BACKUP_PATH is set to /pgdata/pitr-backups/2018-05-10-18-07-58.
....

Edit the `restore-pitr.json` file and change the `BACKUP_PATH` environment variable
using the path discovered above (note: `/pgdata/` is not required and should be excluded
in the variable):

....
{
    "name": "BACKUP_PATH",
    "value": "pitr-backups/2018-05-10-18-07-58"
{
....

Next, we restore prior to the `beforechanges` recovery target.  This
recovery point is *before* the *pitrtest* table is created.

Edit the `restore-pitr.json` file, and edit the environment
variable to indicate we want to use the `beforechanges` recovery
point:
....
{
    "name": "RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME",
    "value": "beforechanges"
{
....


Then run the following to create the restored database container:
....
./run-restore-pitr.sh
....

After the database has restored, you should be able to perform
a test to see if the recovery worked as expected:
....
psql -h restore-pitr -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
psql -h restore-pitr -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
....

The output of these commands should show that the *pitrtest* table is not
present.  It should also show that you can not create a new table
because the database is paused in read-only mode.

To make the database resume as a writable database, run the following
SQL command:
....
select pg_wal_replay_resume();
....

It should then be possible to write to the database:
....
psql -h restore-pitr -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
....

You can also test that if `afterchanges` is specified, that the
*pitrtest* table is present but that the database is still in recovery
mode.

Lastly, you can test a full recovery using *all* of the WAL files, if
you remove the `RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME` environment variable completely.

The storage portions of this example can all be found under `$CCP_STORAGE_PATH`.

== Connection Pooling

=== pgBouncer

Crunchy pgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL databases.

The following examples create the following containers:

  * pgBouncer Primary
  * pgBouncer Replica
  * PostgreSQL Primary
  * PostgreSQL Replica

In Kubernetes and OpenShift, this example will also create:

  * pgBouncer Primary Service
  * pgBouncer Replica Service
  * Primary Service
  * Replica Service
  * PostgreSQL Secrets
  * pgBouncer Secrets

To cleanup the objects created by this example, run the following in the `pgbouncer` example directory:

....
./cleanup.sh
....

{{% notice tip %}}

psql -d pgbouncer -h pgbouncer-replica -p 6432 -U pgbouncer -c "SHOW SERVERS"
....

=== pgPool II

An example is provided that will run a *pgPool II* container in conjunction with the
*primary-replica* example provided above.

You can execute both `INSERT` and `SELECT` statements after connecting to pgpool.
The container will direct `INSERT` statements to the primary and `SELECT` statements
will be sent round-robin to both the primary and replica.

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called
*testuser* and a default password of *password*.

You can view the nodes that pgpool is configured for by running:
....
psql -h pgpool -U testuser userdb -c 'show pool_nodes'
....

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Create the container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgpool
./run.sh
....

The example is configured to allow the *testuser* to connect
to the *userdb* database.
....
psql -h localhost -U testuser -p 12003 userdb
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Run the following command to deploy the pgpool service:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgpool
./run.sh
....

The example is configured to allow the *testuser* to connect
to the *userdb* database.
....
psql -h pgpool -U testuser userdb
....

== Database

=== Single Primary

This example starts a single PostgreSQL container and service, the most simple
of examples.

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called *testuser*
and a default password of *password*.

For all environments, the script additionally creates:

 * A persistent volume claim
 * A crunchy-postgres container named *primary*
 * The database using predefined environment variables

And specifically for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:

 * A pod named *primary*
 * A service named *primary*
 * A PVC named *primary-pgdata*
 * The database using predefined environment variables

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To create the example and run the container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary
./run.sh
....

Connect from your local host as follows:
....
psql -h localhost -U testuser -W userdb
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

To create the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary
./run.sh
....

Connect from your local host as follows:
....
psql -h primary -U postgres postgres
....

==== Helm

This example resides under the `$CCPROOT/examples/helm` directory. View the README to run this
example using Helm link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/examples/helm/primary/README.md[here].

=== PostgreSQL Deployment

Starting in release 1.2.8, the PostgreSQL container can accept
an environment variable named `PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE`.  If set,
the `/pgdata/subdir` path will use a subdirectory name of your
choosing instead of the default which is the hostname of the container.

This example shows how a Deployment of a PostgreSQL primary is
supported. A pod is a deployment that uses a hostname generated by
Kubernetes; because of this, a new hostname will be defined upon
restart of the primary pod.

For finding the `/pgdata` that pertains to the pod, you will need
to specify a `/pgdata/subdir` name that never changes. This requirement is
handled by the `PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE` environment variable.

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called
*testuser* and a default password of *password*.

This example will create the following in your Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:

 * primary-deployment service which uses a PVC to persist PostgreSQL data
 * replica-deployment service, uses emptyDir persistence
 * primary-deployment deployment of replica count 1 for the primary
   PostgreSQL database pod
 * replica-deployment deployment of replica count 1 for the replica
 * replica2-deployment deployment of replica count 1 for the 2nd replica
 * ConfigMap to hold a custom `postgresql.conf`, `setup.sql`, and
   `pg_hba.conf` files
 * Secrets for the primary user, superuser, and normal user to
   hold the passwords
 * Volume mount for `/backrestrepo` and `/pgwal`

The persisted data for the PostgreSQL primary is found under `/pgdata/primary-deployment`.
If you delete the primary pod, the deployment will create another
pod for the primary and will be able to start up immediately since
it works out of the same `/pgdata/primary-deployment` data directory.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-deployment
./run.sh
....

=== Replication

This example starts a primary and a replica pod containing a PostgreSQL database.

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called
*testuser* and a default password of *password*.

For the Docker environment, the script additionally creates:

 * A docker volume using the local driver for the primary
 * A docker volume using the local driver for the replica
 * A container named *primary* binding to port 12007
 * A container named *replica* binding to port 12008
 * A mapping of the PostgreSQL port 5432 within the container to the localhost port 12000
 * The database using predefined environment variables

And specifically for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:

 * emptyDir volumes for persistence
 * A pod named *pr-primary*
 * A pod named *pr-replica*
 * A pod named *pr-replica-2*
 * A service named *pr-primary*
 * A service named *pr-replica*
 * The database using predefined environment variables

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To create the example and run the container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary-replica
./run.sh
....

Connect from your local host as follows:
....
psql -h localhost -p 12007 -U testuser -W userdb
psql -h localhost -p 12008 -U testuser -W userdb
....

==== Docker-Compose

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/compose/primary-replica
docker-compose up
....

To deploy more than one replica, run the following:
....
docker-compose up --scale db-replica=3
....

To connect to the created database containers, first identify the ports exposed
on the containers:

....
docker ps
....

Next, using psql, connect to the service:
....
psql -d userdb -h 0.0.0.0 -p <CONTAINER_PORT> -U testuser
....

{{% notice tip %}}
See `PG_PASSWORD` in `docker-compose.yml` for the user password.
{{% /notice %}}

To tear down the example, run the following:
....
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Run the following command to deploy a primary and replica database cluster:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica
./run.sh
....

It takes about a minute for the replica to begin replicating with the
primary.  To test out replication, see if replication is underway
with this command:
....
psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

If you see a line returned from that query it means the primary is replicating
to the replica.  Try creating some data on the primary:
....
psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'
....

Then verify that the data is replicated to the replica:
....
psql -h pr-replica -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
....

*primary-replica-dc*

If you wanted to experiment with scaling up the number of replicas, you can run the following example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica-dc
./run.sh
....

You can verify that replication is working using the same commands as above.

This example creates 2 replicas when it initially starts.  To scale
up the number of replicas and view what the deployment looks like before and after, run these commands:
....
${CCP_CLI} get deployment
${CCP_CLI} scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=3 deployment/replica-dc
${CCP_CLI} get deployment
${CCP_CLI} get pod
....

You can verify that you now have 3 replicas by running this query
on the primary:
....
psql -h primary-dc -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

==== Helm

This example resides under the `$CCPROOT/examples/helm` directory. View the README to run this example
using Helm link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/examples/helm/primary-replica/README.md[here].

=== Synchronous Replication

This example deploys a PostgreSQL cluster with a primary, a synchronous replica, and
an asynchronous replica. The two replicas share the same service.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To run this example, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/sync
./run.sh
....

You can test the replication status on the primary by using the following command
and the password *password*:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

You should see 2 rows; 1 for the asynchronous replica and 1 for the synchronous replica.  The
`sync_state` column shows values of async or sync.

You can test replication to the replicas by first entering some data on
the primary, and secondly querying the replicas for that data:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12011 -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12012 -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/sync
./run.sh
....

Connect to the *primarysync* and *replicasync* databases as follows for both the
Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:
....
psql -h primarysync -U postgres postgres -c 'create table test (id int)'
psql -h primarysync -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into test values (1)'
psql -h primarysync -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from test'
psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from test'
psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from test'
....

This set of queries will show you the IP address of the PostgreSQL replica
container. Note the changing IP address due to the round-robin service proxy
being used for both replicas.  The example queries also show that both
replicas are replicating successfully from the primary.

=== Statefulsets

This example deploys a statefulset named *statefulset*.  The statefulset
is a new feature in Kubernetes as of version 1.5 and in OpenShift Origin as of
version 3.5. Statefulsets have replaced PetSets going forward.

Please view link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets/[this Kubernetes description]
to better understand what a Statefulset is and how it works.

This example creates 2 PostgreSQL containers to form the set.  At
startup, each container will examine its hostname to determine
if it is the first container within the set of containers.

The first container is determined by the hostname suffix assigned
by Kubernetes to the pod.  This is an ordinal value starting with *0*.
If a container sees that it has an ordinal value of *0*, it will
update the container labels to add a new label of:
....
name=$PG_PRIMARY_HOST
....

In this example, `PG_PRIMARY_HOST` is specified as `statefulset-primary`.

By default, the containers specify a value of `name=statefulset-replica`.

There are 2 services that end user applications will use to
access the PostgreSQL cluster, one service (statefulset-primary) routes to the primary
container and the other (statefulset-replica) to the replica containers.
....
$ ${CCP_CLI} get service
NAME            CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    22h
statefulset           None            <none>        5432/TCP   1h
statefulset-primary    10.97.168.138   <none>        5432/TCP   1h
statefulset-replica   10.97.218.221   <none>        5432/TCP   1h
....

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/statefulset
./run.sh
....

You can access the primary database as follows:
....
psql -h statefulset-primary -U postgres postgres
....

You can access the replica databases as follows:
....
psql -h statefulset-replica -U postgres postgres
....

You can scale the number of containers using this command; this will
essentially create an additional replica database.
....
${CCP_CLI} scale --replicas=3 statefulset statefulset
....

==== Helm

This example resides under the `$CCPROOT/examples/helm` directory. View the README to
run this example using Helm link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/examples/helm/statefulset/README.md[here].

=== Geospatial (PostGIS)

An example is provided that will run a PostgreSQL with PostGIS pod and service in Kubernetes and OpenShift and a container in Docker.

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called
*testuser* and a default password of *password*.

You can view the extensions that postgres-gis has enabled by running the following command and viewing the listed PostGIS packages:
....
psql -h postgres-gis -U testuser userdb -c '\dx'
....

To validate that PostGIS is installed and which version is running, run the command:

....
psql -h postgres-gis -U testuser userdb -c "SELECT postgis_full_version();"
....

You should expect to see output similar to:

....
postgis_full_version
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 POSTGIS="2.4.2 r16113" PGSQL="100" GEOS="3.5.0-CAPI-1.9.0 r4084" PROJ="Rel. 4.8.0, 6 March 2012" GDAL="GDAL 1.11.4, released 2016/01/25" LIBXML="2.9.1" LIBJSON="0.11" TOPOLOGY RASTER
(1 row)
....

As an exercise for invoking some of the basic PostGIS functionality for validation, try defining a 2D geometry point while giving inputs of
longitude and latitude through this command.

....
psql -h postgres-gis -U testuser userdb -c "select ST_MakePoint(28.385200,-81.563900);"
....

You should expect to see output similar to:

....
                st_makepoint
--------------------------------------------
 0101000000516B9A779C623C40B98D06F0166454C0
(1 row)
....

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Create the container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/postgres-gis
./run.sh
....

Enter the following command to connect to the postgres-gis container that is
mapped to your local port 12000:
....
psql -h localhost -U testuser -p 12000 userdb
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/postgres-gis
./run.sh
....

=== Custom Configuration

You can use your own version of the SQL file `setup.sql` to customize
the initialization of database data and objects when the container and
database are created.

This works by placing a file named `setup.sql` within the `/pgconf` mounted volume
directory.  Portions of the `setup.sql` file are required for the container
to work; please see comments within the sample `setup.sql` file.

If you mount a `/pgconf` volume, crunchy-postgres will look at that directory
for `postgresql.conf`, `pg_hba.conf`, `pg_ident.conf`, SSL server/ca certificates and `setup.sql`.
If it finds one of them it will use that file instead of the default files.

==== Docker

This example can be run as follows for the Docker environment:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/custom-config
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config
./run.sh
....

=== SSL Authentication

This example shows how you can configure PostgreSQL to use SSL for
client authentication.

The example requires SSL certificates and keys to be created.  Included in
the examples directory is a script to create self-signed certificates (server
and client) for the example: `$CCPROOT/examples/ssl-creator.sh`.

The example creates a client certificate for the user `testuser`.  Furthermore,
the server certificate is created for the server name `custom-config-ssl`.

If as a client it's required to confirm the identity of the server, `verify-full` can be
specified in the connection string.  This will check if the server and the server certificate
have the same name:
....
psql postgresql://custom-config-ssl:5432/postgres?sslmode=verify-full -U testuser"
....

To connect via IP, `sslmode` can be changed to `require`.
....
psql postgresql://IP_OF_PGSQL:5432/postgres?sslmode=require -U testuser"
....

This example can be run as follows for the Docker environment:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/custom-config-ssl
./run.sh
....

And the example can be run in the following directory for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl
./run.sh
....

A required step to make this example work is to define
in your `/etc/hosts` file an entry that maps `custom-config-ssl`
to the service IP address for the container.

For instance, if your service has an address as follows:
....
${CCP_CLI} get service
NAME                CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                   AGE
custom-config-ssl   172.30.211.108   <none>        5432/TCP
....

Then your `/etc/hosts` file needs an entry like this:
....
172.30.211.108 custom-config-ssl
....

For production Kubernetes and OpenShift installations, it will likely be preferred for DNS
names to resolve to the PostgreSQL service name and generate
server certificates using the DNS names instead of the example
name `custom-config-ssl`.

In order to connect via certificate, environment variables must be set that point
to the client certificates.  Source the `env.sh` file to set environment varaibles
for the example:

....
source env.sh
....

If as a client it's required to confirm the identity of the server, `verify-full` can be
specified in the connection string.  This will check if the server and the server certificate
have the same name:

....
psql postgresql://custom-config-ssl:5432/userdb?sslmode=verify-full -U testuser"
....

To connect via IP, `sslmode` can be changed to `require`.

....
psql postgresql://IP_OF_PGSQL:5432/userdb?sslmode=require -U testuser"
....

You should see a connection that looks like the following:
....
psql (10.5)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

userdb=>
....

=== Docker Swarm

This example shows how to run a primary and replica database
container on a Docker Swarm (v.1.12) cluster.

First, set up a cluster. The Kubernetes libvirt coreos cluster
example works well; see link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/libvirt-coreos/[coreos-libvirt-cluster.]

Next, on each node, create the Swarm using these
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/[Swarm Install instructions.]

Include this command on the manager node:
....
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.10.1
....

Then this command on all the worker nodes:
....
 docker swarm join \
     --token SWMTKN-1-65cn5wa1qv76l8l45uvlsbprogyhlprjpn27p1qxjwqmncn37o-015egopg4jhtbmlu04faon82u \
         192.168.10.1.37
....

Before creating Swarm services, it is necessary
to define an overlay network to be used by the services you will
create. This can be done as follows:
....
docker network create --driver overlay crunchynet
....

We want to have the primary database always placed on
a specific node. This is accomplished using node constraints
as follows:
....
docker node inspect kubernetes-node-1 | grep ID
docker node update --label-add type=primary 18yrb7m650umx738rtevojpqy
....

In the above example, the `kubernetes-node-1` node with ID
`18yrb7m650umx738rtevojpqy` has a user defined label of *primary* added to it.
The primary service specifies *primary* as a constraint when created; this
tells Swarm to place the service on that specific node.  The replica specifies
a constraint of `node.labels.type != primary` to have the replica
always placed on a node that is not hosting the primary service.

==== Docker

After you set up the Swarm cluster, you can then run this example as follows on the *Swarm Manager Node*:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/swarm-service
./run.sh
....

You can then find the nodes that are running the primary and replica containers
by:
....
docker service ps primary
docker service ps replica
....

You can also scale up the number of *replica* containers.
....
docker service scale replica=2
docker service ls
....

Verify you have two replicas within PostgreSQL by viewing the `pg_stat_replication` table.
The password is *password* by default when logged into the `kubernetes-node-1` host:
....
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q) psql -U postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication' postgres
....

You should see a row for each replica along with its replication status.

== Failover

=== Watch

Crunchy Watch is an application wrapped in a container that watches a PostgreSQL
primary database and waits for a failure to occur, at which point a failover is
performed to promote a replica.

The crunchy-watch container, while originally part of the Container Suite, has been
split out into its own project. More information on the Watch container and it's
capabilities can be found in the new project repository located at
https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-watch.

== Metrics and Performance

=== pgBadger

pgbadger is a PostgreSQL tool that reads the log files from a specified database
in order to produce a HTML report that shows various PostgreSQL statistics and graphs.
This example runs the pgbadger HTTP server against a crunchy-postgres container and
illustrates how to view the generated reports.

The port utilized for this tool is port 14000 for Docker environments and port 10000
for Kubernetes and OpenShift environments.

A requirement to build this container from source is *golang*. On RHEL 7.2, golang
is found in the 'server optional' repository which needs to be enabled in order to install
this dependency.
....
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
....

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called
*testuser* and a default password of *password*.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Run the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgbadger
./run.sh
....

After execution, the container will run and provide a simple HTTP
command you can browse to view the report.  As you run queries against
the database, you can invoke this URL to generate updated reports:
....
curl -L http://127.0.0.1:14000/api/badgergenerate
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgbadger
./run.sh
....

After execution, the container will run and provide a simple HTTP
command you can browse to view the report.  As you run queries against
the database, you can invoke this URL to generate updated reports:
....
curl -L http://pgbadger:10000/api/badgergenerate
....

You can view the database container logs using these commands:
....
${CCP_CLI} logs pgbadger -c pgbadger
${CCP_CLI} logs pgbadger -c postgres
....

=== Metrics Collection

You can collect various PostgreSQL metrics from your database
container by running a crunchy-collect container that points
to your database container.

This example starts up 5 containers:

 * Collect (crunchy-collect)
 * Grafana (crunchy-grafana)
 * PostgreSQL (crunchy-postgres)
 * Prometheus (crunchy-prometheus)

Every 5 seconds by default, Prometheus will scrape the Collect container
for metrics.  These metrics will then be visualized by Grafana.

By default, Prometheus detects which environment its running on (Docker, Kubernetes, or OpenShift Container Platform)
and applies a default configuration. If this container is running on Kubernetes or OpenShift Container Platform,
it will use the Kubernetes API to discover pods with the label `"crunchy-collect": "true"`.

The collect container *must* have this label to be discovered in these environments.
Additionally, the collect container uses a special PostgreSQL role `ccp_monitoring`.
This user is created by setting the `PGMONITOR_PASSWORD` environment variable on the
PostgreSQL container.

Discovering pods requires a cluster role service account.  See the
link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/examples/kube/metrics/metrics.json[Kubernetes and OpenShift]
metrics JSON file for more details.

For Docker environments the collect hostname must be specified as an environment
variable.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To start this set of containers, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/metrics
./run.sh
....

You will be able to access the Grafana and Prometheus services from the following
web addresses:

 * Grafana (http://0.0.0.0:3000)
 * Prometheus (http://0.0.0.0:9090)

The crunchy-postgres container is accessible on port *5432*.

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/metrics
./run.sh
....

It's required to use `port-forward` to access the Grafana dashboard.  To start the
port-forward, run the following command:

....
${CCP_CLI} port-forward metrics 3000:3000
${CCP_CLI} port-forward metrics 9090:9090
....

 * Grafana dashboard can be then accessed from `http://127.0.0.01:3000`
 * Prometheus dashboard can be then accessed from `http://127.0.0.01:9090`

You can view the container logs using these command:
....
${CCP_CLI} logs -c grafana metrics
${CCP_CLI} logs -c prometheus metrics
${CCP_CLI} logs -c collect primary
${CCP_CLI} logs -c postgres primary
${CCP_CLI} logs -c collect replica
${CCP_CLI} logs -c postgres replica
....

=== pg_audit

This example provides an example of enabling pg_audit output.
As of release 1.3, pg_audit is included in the crunchy-postgres
container and is added to the PostgreSQL shared library list in
`postgresql.conf`.

Given the numerous ways pg_audit can be configured, the exact
pg_audit configuration is left to the user to define.  pg_audit
allows you to configure auditing rules either in `postgresql.conf`
or within your SQL script.

For this test, we place pg_audit statements within a SQL script
and verify that auditing is enabled and working.  If you choose
to configure pg_audit via a `postgresql.conf` file, then you will
need to define your own custom file and mount it to override the
default `postgresql.conf` file.

==== Docker

Run the following to create a database container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgaudit
./run.sh
....

This starts an instance of the pg_audit container (running crunchy-postgres)
on port 12005 on localhost. The test script is then automatically executed.

This test executes a SQL file which contains pg_audit configuration
statements as well as executes some basic SQL commands.  These
SQL commands will cause pg_audit to create log messages in
the `pg_log` log file created by the database container.

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgaudit
./run.sh
....

The script will create the pg_audit pod (running the crunchy-postgres container)
on the Kubernetes instance and then execute a SQL file which
contains pg_audit configuration statements as well as some
basic SQL commands.  These SQL commands will cause pg_audit to create
log messages in the `pg_log` file created by the database container.
