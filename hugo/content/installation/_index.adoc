== Installation

To set up the environment, visit the link:/installation/environment-setup/[Environment Setup] document.
From there, navigate to link:/installation/build-the-containers/[Build the Containers] page to either
build or pull the container images necessary to run examples. The final step will be to configure storage
in the link:/installation/storage-configuration/[Storage Configuration] page, with either HostPath, NFS,
or dynamic storage options.

== Next Steps

There are many ways to configure the examples and containers further. Descriptions of each container
offered and the variables that can be used to customize them are found on the
link:/container-specifications/[Container Specifications] page.

Information can be found on the full scope of examples that can be performed on the
link:/getting-started/[Getting Started] page.
