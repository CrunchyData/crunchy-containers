== Build the Containers

At this point, you have a decision to make - either download prebuilt
containers from link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], *or* build the containers on your local host.

To download the prebuilt containers, make sure you can login to
link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], and then run the following:
....
docker login
cd $CCPROOT
./bin/pull-from-dockerhub.sh
....

Or if you'd rather build the containers from source, perform a container
build as follows:

....
godep restore
cd $CCPROOT
make setup
make all
....

After this, you will have all the Crunchy containers built and are ready
for use in a *standalone Docker* environment.

== Next Steps

Next, configure a storage type as demonstrated in the link:/installation/storage-configuration/[Storage Configuration] document.
