== crunchy-postgres

The crunchy-postgres container executes the Postgres database.

=== Packages

The container image is built using either the Crunchy Postgres release
or the community version based upon a flag in the Makefile.

The crunchy-postgres RPMs are available to Crunchy customers only.  The
Crunchy release is meant for customers that require enterprise level
support.

The PGDG community RPMs can be used as well by simply commenting out
the Crunchy yum repo within the Dockerfiles and uncommenting
the PGDG yum repo.

=== setup.sql

The *setup.sql* script is used to define startup SQL commands that are
executed when the database is first created.

=== Environment Variables

 * PG_MODE - either *primary*, *replica* or *set*, this value determines whether
   the database is set up as a primary or replica instance. In the
   case of *set*, it means the container is started within a StatefulSet
   in a Kubernetes cluster.
 * PG_PRIMARY_USER - the value to use for the user ID created as
   primaryuser.  The *primaryuser* has super user privileges.
 * PG_PRIMARY_PASSWORD - the password for the PG_PRIMARY_USER database user
 * PG_USER - the value to use for the user ID created as a normal user.
   This user is created as part of the setup.sql script upon database
   creation and allows users to predefine an application user.
 * PG_PASSWORD - the password for the PG_USER database user that is created
 * PG_DATABASE - a database that is created upon database initialization
 * PG_ROOT_PASSWORD - the PostgreSQL user password set up upon database
   initialization
 * PG_LOCALE - if set, the locale you want to create the database with, if
   not set, the default locale is used
 * SYNC_REPLICA - if set, this value is used to specify the application_name
   of a replica that will be used for a synchronous replication
 * CHECKSUMS - if set, this value is used to enable the *--data-checksums*
   option when initdb is executed at initialization, if not set, the
   default is to *not* enable data checksums
 * ARCHIVE_MODE - if set to *on*, will enable continuous WAL archiving
   by setting the value within the postgresql.conf file *archive_mode*
   setting, if not set, the default is *off*
 * ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT - if set to a number (in seconds) , will specify
   the postgresql.conf *archive_timeout* setting, if not set, the
   default value of *60* is used.
 * PGAUDIT_ANALYZE - if set, will cause the container to also start the
   pgaudit_analyze program in the background
 * PG_PRIMARY_HOST - for when PG_MODE is *set*, specifies the primary
   host for setting the primary label
 * PG_REPLICA_HOST - for when PG_MODE is *set*, specifies the replica
   host for setting the replica label
 * PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE - if set, will cause the container to use a /pgdata path
   name of your choosing rather than the hostname of the container which
   is the default. This is useful for a primary in a deployment.
 * XLOGDIR - if set to true, will cause initdb to include --xlogdir=$PGWAL, this
   will cause a symlink to be created from /pgdata/containername/pg_wal (or pg_xlog if you're running PG 9.5 or 9.6) to /pgwal/containername-wal
 * TEMP_BUFFERS - default is 8MB, set this value to override this PostgreSQL configuration setting
 * MAX_CONNECTIONS - default is 100, set this value to override this PostgreSQL configuration setting
 * SHARED_BUFFERS - default is 128MB, set this value to override this PostgreSQL configuration setting
 * WORK_MEM - default is 4MB, set this value to override this PostgreSQL configuration setting
 * MAX_WAL_SENDERS - default is 6, set this value to override this PostgreSQL configuration setting
 * ENABLE_SSHD- default is false, set this value to true to enable SSHD
 * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
   Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

=== Features

The following features are supported by the crunchy-postgres container:

 * use of OpenShift secrets
 * ability to restore from a database backup
 * use of custom pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf files
 * ability to override postgresql.conf configuration parameters
 * ability to override the default setup.sql script
 * ability to set the database locale
 * ability to specify a synchronous replica application_name
 * ability to specify a recovery using PITR and WAL files
 * ability to enable SSHD

=== Locale Support

Adding locale support to the container is accomplished by
running 'yum reinstall glibc_common' within the container, this
increases the size of the container image and can be removed if you
do not require specific locale support.

You can specify the PG_LOCALE env var which is passed to the initdb
command when the initial data files are created, for example:
....
"name": "PG_LOCALE",
"value": "fr_BE.UTF-8"
....

By default, no locale is specified when the initdb command is executed.

== crunchy-postgres-gis

This container is the same as the crunchy-postgres container except
that it includes the following PostgreSQL extensions:

 * postgis
 * pl/r

You can test the pl/r extension by running the following commands
for example:
....
create extension plr;
SELECT * FROM plr_environ();
SELECT load_r_typenames();
SELECT * FROM r_typenames();
SELECT plr_array_accum('{23,35}', 42);
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION plr_array (text, text)
RETURNS text[]
AS '$libdir/plr','plr_array'
LANGUAGE 'c' WITH (isstrict);
select plr_array('hello','world');
....

== crunchy-backup

The crunchy-backup container executes a pg_basebackup against another
database container.  The backup is a full backup using the standard
utility included with PostgreSQL, pg_basebackup.

=== Backup Location

Backups are stored in a mounted backup volume location, using the
database host name plus *-backups*  as a sub-directory, then followed by a unique
backup directory based upon a date/timestamp.  It is left to the
user to perform database backup archives in this current version
of the container.  This backup location is referenced when performing
a database restore.

=== Dependencies

The container is meant to be using NFS or a similar network file system
to persist database backups.

=== Environment Variables

 * BACKUP_LABEL - when set, will set the label of the backup, if not
   set the default label used is *crunchy-backup*
 * BACKUP_HOST - required, this is the database we will be doing the
   backup for
 * BACKUP_USER - required, this is the database user we will be doing the
   backup with
 * BACKUP_PASS - required, this is the database password we will be doing the
   backup with
 * BACKUP_PORT - required, this is the database port we will be doing the
   backup with
 * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
   Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

== crunchy-pgdump

The crunchy-pgdump container executes either a pg_dump or pg_dumpall against another
Postgres database.

=== Dump Location

Dumps are stored in a mounted backup volume location, using the
database host name plus *-backups*  as a sub-directory, then followed by a unique
backup directory based upon a date/timestamp.  It is left to the
user to perform database dump archives in this current version
of the container.

== crunchy-collect

=== Description

Crunchy Collect container provides real time metrics about the PostgreSQL database
via an API.  These metrics are scrapped and stored by Crunchy Prometheus time-series
database and visualized by Crunchy Grafana.

=== Requirements

This container requires TCP access to the PostgreSQL database to run queries for
collecting metrics.  The PostgreSQL database to be scrapped is specified by the
*DATA_SOURCE_NAME* environment variable.

Additionally, custom queries to collect metrics can be specified by the user.  By
mounting a *queries.yml* file to */conf* on the container, additionally metrics
can be specified for the API to collect.  For an example of a *queries.yml* file, see
link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/conf/collect/queries.yml[here].

=== Environment Variables

*Required:*

 * DATA_SOURCE_NAME - The URL for the PostgreSQL server's data source name.
   This is *required* to be in the form of *postgresql://*.

*Optional:*
 * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
   Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

== crunchy-prometheus

=== Description

Prometheus is a multi-dimensional time series data model with an elastic query language. It is used in collaboration
with Grafana in this metrics suite. Overall, it’s reliable, manageable, and operationally simple for efficiently
storing and analyzing data for large-scale environments. It scraps metrics from exporters such as
Crunchy Collect.

The following port is exposed by the crunchy-prometheus container:

 * crunchy-prometheus:9090 - the Prometheus web user interface

=== Requirements

The Crunchy Prometheus container must be able to reach the Crunchy Collect container
to scrape metrics.

By default, Crunchy Prometheus detects which environment its running on (Docker, Kube or OCP)
and applies a default configuration.  If this container is running on Kube or OCP,
it will use the Kubernetes API to discover pods with the label *"crunchy-collect": "true"*.
Crunchy Collect container must have this label to be discovered.

For Docker environments the Crunchy Collect hostname must be specified as an environment
variable.

A user may define a custom *prometheus.yml* file and mount to */conf* for custom configuration.
For a configuration examples, see  link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/conf/prometheus[here].

=== Environment Variables

*Required:*

 * COLLECT_HOST - Hostname of Crunchy Collect container.  Only required in *Docker*
   environments.

*Optional:*

 * SCRAPE_INTERVAL - default is "5s", set this value to the number of seconds to scrape
   metrics from exporters.
 * SCRAPE_TIMEOUT - default is "5s", set this value to the number of seconds to timeout when scraping
   metrics from exporters.
 * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
   Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

== crunchy-grafana

=== Description

Visual dashboards are created from the collected and stored data that crunchy-collect and crunchy-prometheus
provides with the crunchy-grafana container, which hosts a web-based graphing dashboard called Grafana.

Grafana is an open-source platform which can then apply the defined metrics and visualize information through
various tools. It is extremely flexible with a powerful query and transformation language, producing beautiful
and easily understandable graphics to analyze and monitor your data.

By default, Crunchy Grafana will register the Crunchy Prometheus datasource within
Grafana and import a premade dashboard for PostgreSQL monitoring.

The following port is exposed by the crunchy-grafana container:

 * crunchy-grafana:3000 - the Grafana web user interface

=== Requirements

The Crunchy Grafana container must be able to reach the Crunchy Prometheus container.

Users must specify an administrator user and password to provide basic authentication
for the web frontend.

Additionally the Prometheus Host and Port are required.  If Prometheus uses basic
authentication, users must specify the username and password to access Prometheus
via environment variables.

Users may define a custom *defaults.ini* file and mount to */conf* for custom configuration.
For a configuration examples, see  link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/conf/grafana/defaults.ini[here].

=== Environment Variables

*Required:*

 * ADMIN_USER - specifies the administrator user to be used when logging into the
   web frontend.
 * ADMIN_PASS - specifies the administrator password to be used when logging into the
   web frontend.
 * PROM_HOST - specifies the Prometheus container hostname for auto registering the
   prometheus datasource.
 * PROM_PORT - specifies the Prometheus container port for auto registering the
   prometheus datasource.

 * PROM_PASS - specifies the Prometheus password, if one is required.
 * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
   Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

== crunchy-pgbadger

The crunchy-pgbadger container executes the pgbadger utility.  A small
http server is running on the container, when a request is made to:

....
http://<<ip address>>:10000/api/badgergenerate
....

=== Environment Variables

*Optional:*

 * BADGER_TARGET - only used in standalone mode to specify the
   name of the container, also used to find the location of the
   database log files in /pgdata/$BADGER_TARGET/pg_log/*.log
 * BADGER_CUSTOM_OPTS - no default, set this value to provide custom flags to pgbadger.
   For a list of optional flags, see the link:http://dalibo.github.io/pgbadger[official pgBadger documentation].
 * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
   Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

=== Features

The following features are supported by the crunchy-pgbadger container:

 * Generate a full report by default
 * Optional custom options for more advanced use cases (such as `incremental` reports)
 * Report persistence on a volume

== crunchy-pgpool

The crunchy-pgpool container executes the pgpool utility.  Pgpool can
be used to provide a smart PostgreSQL-aware proxy to a PostgreSQL cluster,
both primary and replica, so that applications can only have to work
with a single database connection.

Postgres replicas are read-only whereas a primary is both read and write
capable.

The default pgpool examples use a Secret to hold the set of pgpool
configuration files used by the examples.  The Secret is mounted
into the *pgconf* volume mount where the container will look to
find configuration files.  If you do not specify your own
configuration files via a Secret then you can specify environment
variables to the container that it will attempt to use to
configure pgpool, this is not recommended however for a real
pgpool deployment.

=== Environment Variables

 * PG_USERNAME - user to connect to PostgreSQL
 * PG_PASSWORD - user password to connect to PostgreSQL
 * PG_PRIMARY_SERVICE_NAME - database host to connect to for the primary node
 * PG_REPLICA_SERVICE_NAME - database host to connect to for the replica node
 * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
   Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

=== Features

The following features are supported by the crunchy-pgpool container:

 * basic invocation of pgpool

== crunchy-watch

Crunchy Watch is an application wrapped in a container that watches a PostgreSQL
primary database and waits for a failure to occur, at which point a failover is
performed to promote a replica.

The crunchy-watch container, while originally part of the Container Suite, has been
split out into its own project. More information on the Watch container and it's
capabilities can be found in the new project repository located at
https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-watch.

== crunchy-vacuum

=== Description

The crunchy-vacuum container allows you to perform a SQL VACUUM job against a PostgreSQL database container.
You specify a database to vacuum using various environment variables which are listed below. It is possible
to run different vacuum operations either manually or automatically through scheduling.

The crunchy-vacuum image is executed, passed in the Postgres connection parameters to the single-primary
PostgreSQL container. The type of vacuum performed is dictated by the environment variables passed into the job.

=== Environment Variables

The complete set of environment variables read by the crunchy-vacuum job include:

    * VAC_FULL - when set to true adds the FULL parameter to the VACUUM command
    * VAC_TABLE - when set, allows you to specify a single table to vacuum, when not specified, the entire database tables are vacuumed
    * JOB_HOST - required variable is the postgres host we connect to
    * PG_USER - required variable is the postgres user we connect with
    * PG_DATABASE - required variable is the postgres database we connect to
    * PG_PASSWORD - required variable is the postgres user password we connect with
    * PG_PORT - allows you to override the default value of 5432
    * VAC_ANALYZE - when set to true adds the ANALYZE parameter to the VACUUM command
    * VAC_VERBOSE - when set to true adds the VERBOSE parameter to the VACUUM command
    * VAC_FREEZE - when set to true adds the FREEZE parameter to the VACUUM command
    * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
      Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

== crunchy-dba

The crunchy-dba container implements a cron scheduler.  The purpose
of the crunchy-dba container is to offer a way to perform
simple DBA tasks that occur on some form of schedule such as
backup jobs or running a vacuum on a *single* Postgres database container.

You can either run the crunchy-dba container as a single pod or include
the container within a database pod.

The crunchy-dba container makes use of a Service Account to perform
the startup of scheduled jobs.  The Kube Job type is used to execute
the scheduled jobs with a Restart policy of Never.

=== Environment Variables

The following environment variables control the actions
of crunchy-dba:

 * OSE_PROJECT - required, the OSE project name to log into
 * JOB_HOST - required, the PostgreSQL container name the action will be taken against
 * VAC_SCHEDULE - if set, this will start a vacuum job container.  The
 setting value must be a valid cron expression as described below.
 * BACKUP_SCHEDULE - if set, this will start a backup job container.  The
 setting value must be a valid cron expression as described below.
 * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
   Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

For a vacuum job, you are required to supply the following
environment variables:

 * JOB_HOST
 * PG_USER
 * PG_PASSWORD
 * PG_DATABASE - defaults to postgres when not specified
 * PG_PORT - defaults to 5432 when not specified
 * VAC_ANALYZE(optional) - defaults to true when not specified
 * VAC_FULL(optional) - defaults to true when not specified
 * VAC_VERBOSE(optional) - defaults to true when not specified
 * VAC_FREEZE(optional) - defaults to false when not specified
 * VAC_TABLE(optional) - defaults to all tables when not specified, or you can set this value to indicate a single table to vacuum

For a backup job, you are required to supply the following
environment variables:

 * JOB_HOST
 * PG_USER - database user used to perform the backup
 * PG_PASSWORD - database user password used to perform the backup
 * PG_PORT - port value used when connecting for a backup to the database
 * BACKUP_PV_CAPACITY - a value like 1Gi is used to define the PV storage capacity
 * BACKUP_PV_PATH - the storage path used to build the PV
 * BACKUP_PV_HOST - the storage host used to build the PV
 * BACKUP_PVC_STORAGE - a value like 75M means to allow 75 megabytes for the PVC used
 in performing the backup

=== CRON Expression Format

A cron expression represents a set of times, using 6 space-separated fields.

.Table Fields
[options="header"]
|===
|Field name   | Mandatory? | Allowed values  | Allowed special characters

|Seconds
|Yes
|0-59
|* / , -

|Minutes
|Yes
|0-59
|* / , -

|Hours
|Yes
|0-23
|* / , -

|Day of month
|Yes
|1-31
|* / , - ?

|Month
|Yes
|1-12 or JAN-DEC
|* / , -

|Day of week
|Yes
|0-6 or SUN-SAT
|* / , - ?
|===


NOTE: Month and Day-of-week field values are case insensitive.  ``SUN'', ``Sun'',
and ``sun'' are equally accepted.

==== Special Characters

===== Asterisk ( * )

The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values
of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would
indicate every month.

===== Slash ( / )

Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in
the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every
15 minutes thereafter. The form ``*\/...'' is equivalent to the form
``first-last/...'', that is, an increment over the largest possible range of
the field.  The form ``N/...'' is accepted as meaning ``N-MAX/...'', that is,
starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range.
It does not wrap around.

===== Comma ( , )

Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using
``MON,WED,FRI'' in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays.

===== Hyphen ( - )

Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every
hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive.

===== Question mark ( ? )

Question mark may be used instead of '*' for leaving either day-of-month or
day-of-week blank.

==== Predefined schedules

You may use one of several pre-defined schedules in place of a cron expression.

.Table Predefined Schedules
[options="header"]
|===
|Entry|Description|Equivalent To

|@yearly (or @annually)
| Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st
| 0 0 0 1 1 *

|@monthly
| Run once a month, midnight, first of month
| 0 0 0 1 * *

|@weekly
| Run once a week, midnight on Sunday
| 0 0 0 * * 0

|@daily (or @midnight)
| Run once a day, midnight
| 0 0 0 * * *

|@hourly
| Run once an hour, beginning of hour
| 0 0 * * * *
|===

==== Intervals

You may also schedule a job to execute at fixed intervals.  This is
supported by formatting the cron spec like this:

....
@every <duration>
....

where ``duration'' is a string accepted by time.ParseDuration
(http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).

For example, ``@every 1h30m10s'' would indicate a schedule that activates every
1 hour, 30 minutes, 10 seconds.

NOTE: The interval does not take the job runtime into account.  For example,
if a job takes 3 minutes to run, and it is scheduled to run every 5 minutes,
it will have only 2 minutes of idle time between each run.

==== Time zones

All interpretation and scheduling is done in the machines local
time zone (as provided by the Go time package
(http://www.golang.org/pkg/time).  Be aware that jobs scheduled during
daylight-savings leap-ahead transitions will not be run!

== crunchy-pgbouncer

== crunchy-pgrestore

The restore image provides a means of performing a restore
of a dump from pg_dump or pg_dumpall via psql or pg_restore
to a Postgres container database.

=== Dump-file Input Location

As the input files for crunchy-pgrestore, files generated by crunchy-pgdump
are retrieved in a mounted backup volume location, using the
database host name plus *-backups*  as a sub-directory, then followed by a unique
backup directory based upon a date/timestamp.  It is left to the
user to restore database dump archives in this current version
of the container.

=== Dependencies

The container is meant to be using NFS or a similar network file system
to retrieve database dumps to be restored via psql or pg_restore.

=== Environment Variables

==== REQUIRED ARGS

 * PGRESTORE_DB - Database to connect to
 * PGRESTORE_HOST - Hostname of the PostgreSQL database to connect to
 * PGRESTORE_PASS - Password of the PostgreSQL role used by the pgdump container
 * PGRESTORE_USER - PostgreSQL Role used by the pgdump container

==== OPTIONAL/EXTENDED ARGS

 * PGDUMP_BACKUP_HOST - Hostname of the PostgreSQL server that was backed up by `pgdump` container.  Used when restoring a backup to a new host.
 * PGRESTORE_BACKUP_TIMESTAMP - Timestamp of the backup to restore from.  Default is empty (restores from latest backup)
 * PGRESTORE_CUSTOM_OPTS - Advanced options to pass into `pg_restore`. Default is empty
 * PGRESTORE_PORT - Port of the PostgreSQL database to connect to.  Default is 5432
 * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs
   Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

Note: For a list of advanced options for configuring the `PGRESTORE_CUSTOM_OPTS` variable, see the official documentation:

 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgrestore.html

== crunchy-upgrade

The crunchy-upgrade container contains both the 9.5/9.6 and 9.6/10
Postgres packages in order to perform a pg_upgrade from
9.5 to 9.6 or 9.6 to 10 versions.

=== Environment Variables

 * OLD_DATABASE_NAME - required, refers to the database (pod) name
   that we want to convert
 * NEW_DATABASE_NAME - required, refers to the database (pod) name
   that we give to the upgraded database
 * OLD_VERSION - required, the Postgres version of the old database
 * NEW_VERSION - required, the Postgres version of the new database
 * PG_LOCALE - if set, the locale you want to create the database with, if
   not set, the default locale is used
 * CHECKSUMS - if set, this value is used to enable the *--data-checksums*
   option when initdb is executed at initialization, if not set, the
   default is to *not* enable data checksums
 * XLOGDIR - if set, initdb will use the specified directory for WAL
 * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
   Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

=== Features

The following features are supported by the crunchy-upgrade container:

 * supports only a pg_upgrade of the Postgres database
 * doesn't alter the old database files
 * creates the new database directory

=== Restrictions

 * does NOT support a postgis upgrade currently
 * all environment variables are required
 * supports upgrades from 9.5/9.6 to 10

== crunchy-sim

The crunchy-sim container is a simple traffic simulator for PostgreSQL.

=== Environment Variables

* PGSIM_HOST - required, the PostgreSQL host address
* PGSIM_PORT - required, the PostgreSQL host port
* PGSIM_USERNAME - required, the PostgreSQL username
* PGSIM_PASSWORD - required, the PostgreSQL password
* PGSIM_DATABASE - required, the database to connect
* PGSIM_INTERVAL - required, The units of the simulation interval
* PGSIM_MININTERVAL - required, the minimum interval value
* PGSIM_MAXINTERVAL - requited, the maximum interval value
* CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.
  Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.

Valid values for PGSIM_INTERVAL are as follows:

* millisecond
* second
* minute

=== Features

* Creates a single connection to PostgreSQL and will execute
queries over a specified interval range.
* Queries are specified through a simple YAML file. Each query is a name-value
  pair and can span multiple lines by utilizing scalar notation (``|'' or ``>'') as
  defined by the YAML spec.
* Queries are randomly chosen for execution.

=== Restrictions

* Only one connection is created for all queries.
