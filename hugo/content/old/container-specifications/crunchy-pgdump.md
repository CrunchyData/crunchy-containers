## Volumes

**Name**|**Description**
:-----|:-----
**/pgdata**|Volume used to store the data directory contents for the PostgreSQL database.

## Dump Location

Backups are stored in a mounted backup volume location, using the
database host name plus *-backups*  as a sub-directory, then followed by a unique
backup directory based upon a date/timestamp.  It is left to the
user to perform database backup archives in this current version
of the container. This backup location is referenced when performing
a database restore.
