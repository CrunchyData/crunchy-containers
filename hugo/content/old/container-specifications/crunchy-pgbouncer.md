[pgBouncer](https://pgbouncer.github.io/) is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL databases.

## Features

The following features are supported by the crunchy-pgbouncer container:

 * crunchy-pgbouncer uses `auth_query` to authenticate users.  This requires only the `pgbouncer`
   username and password in `users.txt`.  Automatically generated from environment variables.
 * Mount a custom `users.txt` and `pgbouncer.ini` configurations for advanced usage.
 * Tune pooling parameters via environment variables.
 * Connect to the administration database in pgBouncer to view statistics of the target databases.

## Packages

The crunchy-pgbouncer Docker image contains the following packages (versions vary depending on PostgreSQL version):

* PostgreSQL (11.1, 10.6, 9.6.11 and 9.5.15)
* [pgBouncer](https://pgbouncer.github.io/)
* CentOS7 - publicly available
* RHEL7 - customers only

## Restrictions

 * OpenShift: If custom configurations aren't being mounted, an **emptydir** volume is required
   to be mounted at `/pgconf`.
 * Superusers cannot connect through the connection pooler.
