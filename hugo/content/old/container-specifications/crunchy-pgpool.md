The crunchy-pgpool container executes the [pgPool II](http://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page)
utility. pgPool can be used to provide a smart PostgreSQL-aware proxy to a PostgreSQL cluster, both primary
and replica, so that applications only have to work with a single database connection.

PostgreSQL replicas are read-only whereas a primary is capable of receiving both read and write actions.

The default pgPool examples use a Secret to hold the set of pgPool configuration files used by the examples.
The Secret is mounted into the `pgconf` volume mount where the container will look to find configuration files.
If you do not specify your own configuration files via a Secret then you can specify environment
variables to the container that it will attempt to use to configure pgPool, although this is not recommended
for production environments.

## Features
