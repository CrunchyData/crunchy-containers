For Kubernetes users of these containers, there is an associated
project worth taking a look at that uses the containers found
in this repo and provides a higher level automation.
That project is the link:https://github.com/crunchydata/postgres-operator[postgres-operator].

Further descriptions of each of these containers and environment variables that can be used to tune them
can be found in the link:https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/container-specifications/[Container Specifications] document.

== Getting Started

Complete build and install documentation is found link:https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/installation/[here].  The provided Dockerfiles build the containers
on a Centos 7 base image and use the community PostgreSQL RPMs.

Crunchy provides a commercially supported version of these containers
built upon RHEL 7 and the Crunchy supported PostgreSQL. Contact Crunchy
for more details at http://www.crunchydata.com.

== Usage

Various examples are provided in link:https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/getting-started/[the Getting Started documentation] for running in Docker,
Kubernetes, and OpenShift environments.

You will need to set up your environment as per the link:https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/installation/[Installation documentation] in order to
execute the examples.
