      <description>Running the Examples The Kubernetes and OpenShift examples in this guide have been designed using single-node Kubernetes/OCP clusters whose host machines provide any required supporting infrastructure or services (e.g. local HostPath storage or access to an NFS share). Therefore, for the best results when running these examples, it is recommended that you utilize a single-node architecture as well.
Additionally, the examples located in the kube directory work on both Kubernetes and OpenShift.</description>
