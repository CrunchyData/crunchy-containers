The crunchy-collect container provides real time metrics about the PostgreSQL database via an API. These metrics are scraped and stored by a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) time-series database and are then graphed and visualized through the open source data visualizer [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

## Container Specifications

See the [official documentation](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/crunchy-containers/2.3.0/container-specifications/crunchy-collect/) for more details regarding how the container operates and is customized.

## Examples

For examples regarding the use of the container, see the [official Crunchy Containers GitHub repository](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/tree/master/examples/docker).
