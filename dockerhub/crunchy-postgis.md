# Crunchy Postgres GIS

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/master/images/crunchy_logo.png)

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (pronounced “post-gress-Q-L”) is an open source, ACID compliant, relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by a worldwide team of volunteers. The crunchy-postgres-gis container image is unmodified, open source PostgreSQL packaged and maintained by professionals. This image is identical to the crunchy-postgres image except it includes the open source geospatial extension [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) for PostgreSQL in addition to the language extension PL/R which allows for writing functions in the R statistical computing language.

## Container Specifications

See the [official documentation](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/crunchy-containers/2.3.0/container-specifications/crunchy-postgres-gis/) for more details regarding how the container operates and is customized.
