== Openshift Tutorial
The examples/openshift/workshop directory contains an example as
part of a workshop given on occasion by Redhat and Crunchy.


The example when deployed provides the following:

 * postgres primary database container (pg-primary)
 * postgres replica database container (pg-replica)
 * pgpool postgres load balancer (pgpool)
 * metrics collector container (container inside the pg-primary pod, named collect)
 * pgbadger log analyzer container (inside the pg-primary pod, named pgbadger)
 * pgadmin4 SQL console container (pgadmin4)
 * grafana metrics dashboard container (grafana)
 * prometheus metrics database container (prometheus)
 * prometheus push gateway container (promgateway)
 * backups can be performed using the backup container using the
   crunchy-backup container when executed as a Job

The replica database container is deployed in a replica set, this
allows the replica database to scale up by using an administrative
command.

The pgpool container provides a postgres-smart load balancer
in front of the primary and replica services.  pgpool sends only
the updates/inserts/deletes to the primary database and will
send the select statements to the replica service.

Postgres metrics are collected by the collect container and sent
to the prometheus database which allows for custom dashboard graphs
to be created in the grafana container.

The pgadmin4 container provides a web console where SQL queries can
be entered for configured databases.

To execute the examples, pull down the container images
from Dockerhub onto the VM host:
....
docker pull crunchydata/crunchy-postgres:centos7-9.5-1.4.0
docker pull crunchydata/crunchy-postgres-gis:centos7-9.5-1.4.0
docker pull crunchydata/crunchy-backup:centos7-9.5-1.4.0
docker pull crunchydata/crunchy-collect:centos7-9.5-1.4.0
docker pull crunchydata/crunchy-pgbadger:centos7-9.5-1.4.0
docker pull crunchydata/crunchy-pgadmin4:centos7-9.5-1.4.0
docker pull crunchydata/crunchy-prometheus:centos7-9.5-1.4.0
docker pull crunchydata/crunchy-promgateway:centos7-9.5-1.4.0
docker pull crunchydata/crunchy-grafana:centos7-9.5-1.4.0
docker pull crunchydata/crunchy-watch:centos7-9.5-1.4.0
....


Running the example:

....
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers.git
cd crunchy-containers/examples/workshop
oc new-app -p CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-9.5-1.4.0 -f primary.json
oc new-app -p CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-9.5-1.4.0 -f replicas.json
oc new-app -p CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-9.5-1.4.0 -f pgadmin4.json
oc new-app -p CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-9.5-1.4.0 -f metrics.json
oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts -n default
oc new-app -p CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-9.5-1.4.0 -f watch.json
oc create -f jeff-route.json
....

You can scale up the replicas using this command:
....
oc scale --replicas=2 dc replica-dc
....

It takes about 1 minute for the new replica to become in sync
with the primary.


==== Openshift Console

You can browse to the openshift console at this URL:

....
https://10.2.2.2:8443/console/
....

==== Metrics

Routes have been exposed to allow access to the metrics
web applications.  You can point your browser to
the following URLs after starting the containers:
....
http://grafana-default.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io
http://prometheus-default.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io
....

==== postgres web console

There is a route created to the pgadmin4 web application at the
following URL:
....
http://pgadmin4-default.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io
....

==== pgbadger web application

There is a route created to the pgbadger container within the pgprimary
pod at at the following URL:
....
http://primary-default.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io/api/badgergenerate
....


=== Postgres access from your host

The value of all passwords for the database is *password*, to
access the database, you can enter the following command:

....
psql -h pgprimary.openshift.svc.cluster.local -U postgres postgres
....
