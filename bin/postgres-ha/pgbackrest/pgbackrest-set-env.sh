source /tmp/pgbackrest_env.sh


# Now override any pgBackRest environment variables as needed

# If a bootstrap repo type is specified in the 'replica-bootstrap-repo-type' file (assuming it
# exists), then use the value within it to override the PGBACKREST_REPO_TYPE env var setting
# currently set within the environment.  This is needed in scenarios where it is necessary to 
# override the repo type for specific pgBackRest commands but want to leave the env var set as
# is within the environment.  
#
# For instance, when bootstrapping and fetching archives for a standby cluster, it is necessary
# to ensure only "s3" is utilized for pgBackRest 'restore' and 'archive-get' commands.  However, 
# when the cluster is no longer a standby, this override setting can be removed, and the original
# value for PGBACKREST_REPO_TYPE can be used instead.  This effectively allows this setting to be
# changed dynamically without requiring a container restart to update the PGBACKREST_REPO_TYPE env
# var.
