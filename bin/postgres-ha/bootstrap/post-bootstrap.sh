# to the DB.  This is because when using this bootstrap method, the current instance will still
# be connected to the pgBackRest repository for another cluster (i.e. the cluster being
# bootstrapped from), and we want to ensure there is no ability to push WAL to that repo.  Please
# note that when using 'pgbackrest_init' archive_mode should also be disabled, and this simply 
# serves as an extra precaution.
