Crunchy Container Suite provides Docker containers that enable
rapid deployment of PostgreSQL, including administration and
monitoring tools. Multiple styles of deploying PostgreSQL clusters
are supported.

The containers will execute in the following environments:

 * Docker 1.12
 * Openshift 3.5
 * Kubernetes 1.6

The project includes the following containers:

 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-postgres[crunchy-postgres] - executes Postgres
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-postgres-gis[crunchy-postgres-gis] - executes Postgres plus the PostGIS extensions
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-backup[crunchy-backup] - performs a full database backup
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-pgpool[crunchy-pgpool] - executes pgpool
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-pgbadger[crunchy-pgbadger] - executes pgbadger
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-watch[crunchy-watch] - performs a form of automated failover
 * link:docs/metrics.asciidoc#crunchy-collect[crunchy-collect] - collects Postgres metrics
 * link:docs/metrics.asciidoc#crunchy-prometheus[crunchy-prometheus] -stores Postgres metrics
 * link:docs/metrics.asciidoc#crunchy-grafana[crunchy-grafana] - graphs Postgres metrics
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-pgbouncer[crunchy-pgbouncer] - pgbouncer connection pooler and simple form of failover
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-pgadmin4[crunchy-pgadmin4] - pgadmin4 web application
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-dba[crunchy-dba] - implements a cron scheduler to perform simple DBA tasks
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-upgrade[crunchy-upgrade] - allows you to perform a major postgres upgrade using pg_upgrade
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-backrest-restore[crunchy-backrest-restore] - allows you to perform a pgbackrest restore

For Kubernetes users of these containers, there is an associated
project worth taking a look at that uses the containers found
in this repo and provides a higher level automation.
That project is link:https://github.com/crunchydata/postgres-operator[PostgresOperator]

=== Build Prerequisites

The Crunchy containers have been tested on Centos 7, RHEL 7, Openshift 3.4,
Kubernetes 1.5.3, and Docker 1.12

1) Installing / configuring Docker

On an EL7 system, Docker can be installed with the following commands:

 * sudo yum -y install docker
 * sudo groupadd docker
 * sudo usermod -a -G docker ${USER}
 * sudo systemctl enable docker;systemctl start docker
 * TIP:  remember to log out $USER for the docker group to take effect!

2) Building the Containers (Optional)

If you don't want to pull the containers from link:https://hub.docker.com/u/crunchydata/[DockerHub], you can perform a build of
all the containers locally on your development host.

Complete build and install documentation is found here: link:docs/install.asciidoc[Install Docs].  The provided Dockerfiles build the containers
on a Centos 7 base image and use the community PostgreSQL RPMs.

Crunchy provides a commercially supported version of these containers
built upon RHEL 7 and the Crunchy supported PostgreSQL.  Contact Crunchy
for more details at http://www.crunchydata.com.

=== Examples

Various examples are provided in the /examples directory and described
in the documentation for running Docker, Kubernetes, and Openshift examples..

See the following link for documentation on the Docker
examples: link:docs/docker.asciidoc[docker-examples]

To run the examples, you will need to set the CCP_IMAGE_TAG
environment variable which indicates which version of the
container you will pull down and execute, for example:
....
export CCPROOT=$HOME/crunchy-containers
export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-9.5-1.4.1
....

The CCPROOT is the location of where you cloned the containers github
repository.

The CCP_IMAGE_TAG is the version of the container you want to test
with.  That version is out on Dockerhub.
