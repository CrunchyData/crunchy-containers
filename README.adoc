For Kubernetes users of these containers, there is an associated
project worth taking a look at that uses the containers found
in this repo and provides a higher level automation.
That project is the link:https://github.com/crunchydata/postgres-operator[postgres-operator].

== Getting Started

Complete build and install documentation is found link:docs/install.adoc[here].  The provided Dockerfiles build the containers
on a Centos 7 base image and use the community PostgreSQL RPMs.

Crunchy provides a commercially supported version of these containers
built upon RHEL 7 and the Crunchy supported PostgreSQL. Contact Crunchy
for more details at http://www.crunchydata.com.

== Usage

Various examples are provided in link:docs/examples.adoc[the Examples documentation] for running Docker,
Kubernetes, and OpenShift environments.

You will need to set up your environment as per the link:docs/install.adoc[installation documentation] in order to
execute the examples.
