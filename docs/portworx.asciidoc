== Portworx  Examples

We provide some examples of running the Crunchy containers
using the Portworx Docker volume technology
in the examples/portworx directory.  Those examples are 
explained below.

=== Setup
For these examples, I built a centos7.2 VM, and configured it
according to the Portworx documentation link:http://docs.portworx.com/[here].

The short list of setup commands is like this on a Centos7.2 host:
....
sudo yum -y install etcd
....

Edit the etcd config file to listen to the host IP address instead
of only localhost, edit as follows :
....
sudo vi /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS="http://yourhostname:2379"
ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLIENT_URLS="http://yourhostname:2379"
....

Next start up etcd:
....
sudo systemctl enable etcd.service
sudo systemctl start etcd.service
....

Next, edit the docker daemon config file as follows:
....
sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
MountFlags=shared
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker.service
....

Set up the portworx config file at /etc/pwx/config.json to
look like this:
....
{
  "clusterid": "5ac2ed6f-7e4e-4e1d-8e8c-3a6df1fb61a5",
  "kvdb": [ 
      "etcd:http://yourhostname:2379",
      "etcd:http://yourotherhostname:2379"
    ],
  "storage": {
    "devices": [
      "/dev/vdb",
      "/dev/vdc"
    ]
  }
}
....

In the example above, I have specified 2 disks to use by portworx
for storage exclusively. Also notice that I have 2 hosts configured
for portworx to replicate across in this example.  Also, notice that
the cluster ID has to be the same across all cluster hosts.

Each container has been tested running in selinux enforcing mode.  To
have this work, you will see the following line in the Docker run
commands:
....
--security-opt=label:disable
....

Also, you will notice in the Docker volume create scripts, there is 
the following line that allows the permissions of the Docker volumes
to be set as owned by the postgres UID:
....
--opt uid=26
....


=== Example 1 - Running a single database

Create the container with this command:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/portworx/single-master
./delete.sh
./create-master-volume.sh
./run-pg-master.sh
....

These steps perform the following:

 * delete the master container if it exists and delete the master volume
   if it exists
 * create the Docker volume used by the master container using the Portworx
   volume driver, the volume is named *master-volume*
 * create the Crunchy PostgreSQL container, named *master*, it will mount
   the Docker volume *master-volume* as the means to persist the database
   data files
 * the container maps the PostgreSQL port of 5432 in the container to your 
   local host port of 12000.

The container creates a default database called 'userdb', a default
user called 'testuser' with a default password of 'password', you can
use this to connect from your local host as follows:
....
psql -h localhost -p 12000 -U testuser  userdb
psql -h localhost -p 12000 -U postgres  postgres
....

=== Example 2 - Creating a replica database 

This example shows how you can create a PostgreSQL replica based
on the *master* database created in Example 1, run the example
as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/portworx/single-replica
./delete.sh
./create-replica-volume.sh
./run-replica.sh
....

This script will do the following:

 * start up a container named *replica*
 * mount the Docker volume named *replica-volume* as the */pgdata* directory
 * perform a pg_basebackup to base the initial database upon
 * start the database replication based on the *master* container database
 * maps the PostgreSQL port of 5432 in the container to your local host port of 12001.

use this to connect from your local host as follows:
....
psql -h 192.168.0.112 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres
....

You can test the replication status by connecting to the *master* database
and creating a test table as follows:
....
psql -h 192.168.0.112 -p 12000 -c 'create table foo (id int)' -U postgres postgres
psql -h 192.168.0.112 -p 12000 -c 'table pg_stat_replication' -U postgres postgres
....

Then verify that the table was replicated onto the replica database:
....
psql -h 192.168.0.112 -p 12001 -c 'table foo' -U postgres postgres
....


=== Example 3 - Performing a backup

In order to run this backup script, you first need to edit
run-backup.sh to specify your host IP address you are running
on.  The script assumes you are going to backup the container
created in Example 2.

Run the backup with this command:
....
./run-backup.sh
....

This script will do the following:

 * start up a backup container named masterbackup
 * run pg_basebackup on the container named master
 * store the backup in /tmp/backups/master directory
 * exit after the backup
	
=== Example 4 - Performing a restore

This example shows how to restore a database from an
existing backup volume.  The backup volume created in
the Example 3 is used in this example.


Run the restore with this command:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/portworx/restore
./create-restoredmaster-volume.sh
./run-restore.sh
....

This script will do the following:

 * start up a container named restoredmaster
 * mount the backup volume from Example 3 to /backup
 * pass in an env var (BACKUP_PATH) that points to the backup files
   we want to restore with
 * mount an empty data volume to /pgdata
 * start up the restoredmaster container
 * detects a restore is requested, and performs an rsync
   of the database files from /backup/$BACKUP_PATH to /pgdata
 * maps the PostgreSQL port of 5432 in the container to your local host port of 12002 as to not conflict with the master running in the previous example.

=== Example 5 - pgbadger 

A pgbadger example is provided that will run a HTTP server that 
when invoked, will generate a pgbadger report on a given database.

pgbadger reads the log files from a database to product an HTML report
that shows various Postgres statistics and graphs.

The example depends on Example 1 being run and the *master-volume* data volume
to be present.  To run the example, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/portworx/badger
./run-badger.sh
....

The badger container performs the following:
 * mounts (read-only) the data volume used by the *master* database container
 * runs pgbadger when you make a REST call to the http service
   exposed by the pgbadger container
 * pgbadger when executed, reads the postgres database logs, and produces
   the HTML report which gets sent back to the REST client

After execution, the container will run and provide a simple HTTP
command you can browse to view the report.  As you run queries against
the database, you can invoke this URL to generate updated reports:
....
curl http://127.0.0.1:14000/api/badgergenerate
....

=== Example 6 - custom setup.sql

You can use your own version of the setup.sql SQL file to customize
the initialization of database data and objects when the container and
database are created.

An example can be run as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/portworx/custom-setup
./create-volumes.sh
./create-conf-dir.sh
./run.sh
....

This works by placing a custom version of the setup.sql file into
the docker volume that will be mounted into /pgconf within the 
postgres container.

The postgres container checks for the /pgconf/setup.sql file during
the container startup, if found, it will execute this setup.sql script
instead of the default setup.sql included by default into the container.

This allows users the ability to add their own custom set of objects
to be created for any new database container.

=== Example 7 - pgbouncer

The pgbouncer utility can be used to provide a connection pool
to postgres databases.  The crunchy-pgbouncer container also
contains logic that lets it perform a failover from a master
to a slave database.

To test this failover, you first need to have run the Example 1 
which creates the *master* container, and also the *replica* container
created from Example 2.  

You then can start up the pgbouncer example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/portworx/bouncer/
./create-volumes.sh
./create-conf-dir.sh
./run-pgbouncer.sh
....

You can connect to the pgbouncer *master* database connection
as follows:
....
psql -h 192.168.0.112 -p 12005 -U postgres master
....

You can connect to the pgbouncer *slave* database connection pool
as follows:
....
psql -h 192.168.0.112 -p 12005 -U postgres slave
....

This example configures pgbouncer to provide connection pooling
for the master and replica databases.  It also sets the FAILOVER
environment variable which will cause a failover to be triggered
if the master database can not be reached.

To trigger the failover, stop the master database:

....
docker stop master
....

At this point, the pgbouncer will notice that the master is not reachable
and touch the trigger file on the configured slave database to start
the failover.  The pgbouncer container will then reconfigure 
pgbouncer to relabel the slave database into the master database so clients
to pgbouncer will be able to connect to the master as before the failover.


=== Example 8 - synchronous replication

This example provides a streaming replication configuration that includes both
synchronous and asynchronous slaves.

To run this example, run the following:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/portworx/sync
./create-volumes.sh
./run-sync-master.sh
sleep 20
./run-sync-slave.sh
./run-async-slave.sh
....

You can test the replication status on the master by using the following command:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

You should see 2 rows, 1 for the async slave and 1 for the sync slave.  The
sync_state column shows values of async or sync.

You can test replication to the slaves by entering some data on
the master like this, and then querying the slaves for that data:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12012 -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12013 -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
....
