=== Unit File
The crunchy-pg.service is an example of a systemd unit file
that starts and stops a container named crunchy-pg that
has already been created.

=== test-start.sh

This script is called by the systemd start execution.  The trick
with this script is that it blocks forever after starting the
docker crunchy-pg container.  The blocking in the script
keeps systemd happy and thinking that this is a normal daemon.

=== test-stop.sh

This script stops the test-start.sh script and also stops the
crunchy-pg docker container.
