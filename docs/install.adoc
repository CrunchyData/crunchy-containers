== Project Setup

The crunchy-containers can run on different environments including:

 * *Docker 1.12*
 * *OpenShift Container Platform 3.6*
 * *Kubernetes 1.8+*

In this document we list the basic installation steps required for these
environments.

These installation instructions are developed and tested for the following operating systems:

 * *CentOS 7*
 * *RHEL 7*

=== Project Directory Structure

First add the following lines to your .bashrc file to set
the project paths:
....
export GOPATH=$HOME/cdev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
export CCP_BASEOS=centos7
export CCP_PGVERSION=10
export CCP_PG_FULLVERSION=10.3
export CCP_VERSION=1.8.2
export CCP_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata
export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PG_FULLVERSION-$CCP_VERSION
export CCPROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
export CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT=""
export CCP_CLI=kubectl
export CCP_NAMESPACE=demo
export CCP_STORAGE_PATH=/data
export CCP_STORAGE_MODE=ReadWriteMany
export CCP_STORAGE_CAPACITY=400M
....

NOTE:  the CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT and CCP_STORAGE_PATH settings above indicate you
intend to use *HostPath* storage.  NFS and dynamic storage are
other options, see below for details on configuring storage.

NOTE:  the CCP_CLI setting above indicates you are running the
examples on a Kubernetes platform and not an OpenShift platform.  For
OpenShift, use the value of *oc* as the CCP_CLI variable instead.

It will be necessary to refresh your bashrc file in order for the changes to take
effect.

....
. ~/.bashrc
....

Next, set up a project directory structure and pull down the project:
....
mkdir $HOME/cdev $HOME/cdev/src $HOME/cdev/pkg $HOME/cdev/bin
....

At this point, if you are installing crunchy-containers on a CentOS 7 machine,
you may continue with the following instructions. If you are doing an installation
on RHEL 7, please view the instructions located
link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/install.adoc#rhel-7[below]
that are specific to RHEL environments.

==== CentOS 7
....
cd $GOPATH
sudo yum -y install golang git docker
go get github.com/tools/godep
cd src/github.com
mkdir crunchydata
cd crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
cd crunchy-containers
git checkout 1.8.2
go get github.com/blang/expenv
....

*If you are a Crunchy enterprise customer, you will place the Crunchy repository
key and yum repository file into the $CCPROOT/conf directory at this point. These
files can be obtained through https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads
page.*

==== RHEL 7

When setting up the environment on RHEL 7, there are slightly different steps that
need to be taken.

....
cd $GOPATH
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
sudo yum -y install git golang
go get github.com/tools/godep
cd src/github.com
mkdir crunchydata
cd crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
cd crunchy-containers
git checkout 1.8.2
go get github.com/blang/expenv
....

*If you are a Crunchy enterprise customer, you will place the Crunchy repository
key and yum repository file into the $CCPROOT/conf directory at this point. These
files can be obtained through https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads
page.*

=== Creating a Demo Namespace

In Kubernetes, a concept called a *namespace* provides the means to separate
created resources or components into individual logically grouped partitions.

It is considered a best practice to have dedicated namespaces for projects in
both testing and production environments.

NOTE: All examples in the Crunchy Container Suite operate within the namespace
defined by the environment variable `$CCP_NAMESPACE`. The instructions below
illustrate how to set up and work within new namespaces or projects in both
Kubernetes and OpenShift.

==== Kubernetes

This section will illustrate how to set up a new Kubernetes namespace called *demo*, and will
then show how to provide permissions to that namespace to allow the Kubernetes examples to run
within that namespace.

First, view currently existing namespaces:
....
$ kubectl get namespace
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    21d
kube-public   Active    21d
kube-system   Active    21d
....

Then, create a new namespace called *demo*:
....
$ kubectl create -f $CCPROOT/conf/demo-namespace.json
namespace "demo" created
$ kubectl get namespace demo
NAME      STATUS    AGE
demo      Active    7s
....

Then set the namespace as the current location to avoid using the wrong namespace:
....
$ kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=demo
....

We can verify that the namespace was set correctly through the following command:
....
$ kubectl config view | grep namespace:
    namespace: demo
....

=== OpenShift

This section assumes you are first logging into OpenShift as a normal
user such as:
....
oc login -u someuser
....

For our development purposes only, we typically specify the OCP
Authorization policy of *AllowAll* as documented here:

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/install_config/configuring_authentication.html#AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider

We do not recommend this authentication policy for a production
deployment of OCP.

The next step is to create a *demo* namespace to run the examples within. The
name of this OCP project will be what you supply in the CCP_NAMESPACE
environment variable:
....
$ oc new-project demo --description="Crunchy Containers project" --display-name="Crunchy-Containers"
Now using project "demo" on server "https://127.0.0.1:8443".

$ export CCP_NAMESPACE=demo
....

If we view the list of projects, we can see the new project has been added and is ``active''.
....
$ oc get projects
NAME        DISPLAY NAME         STATUS
demo        Crunchy-Containers   Active
myproject   My Project           Active
....

If you were on a different project and wanted to switch to the demo project, you would do
so by running the following:
....
$ oc project demo
Now using project "demo" on server "https://127.0.0.1:8443".
....

=== Installing PostgreSQL

These installation instructions assume the installation of PostgreSQL 10
through the official PGDG repository. View the documentation located
link:https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/YUM_Installation[here] in
order to view more detailed notes or install a different version of PostgreSQL.

Locate and edit your distributions .repo file, located:

 * On CentOS: /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo, [base] and [updates] sections
 * On Red Hat: /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf [main] section

To the section(s) identified above, you need to append a line (otherwise
dependencies might resolve to the PostgreSQL supplied by the base repository):

....
exclude=postgresql*
....

Next, install the RPM relating to the base operating system and PostgreSQL version
you wish to install. The RPMs can be found link:https://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php[here].

For example, to install PostgreSQL 10 on a CentOS 7 system:
....
sudo yum -y install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/10/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos10-10-2.noarch.rpm
....

Or to install PostgreSQL 10 on a RHEL 7 system:
....
sudo yum -y install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/testing/10/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat10-10-2.noarch.rpm
....

You'll need to update your system:
....
sudo yum -y update
....

Then, go ahead and install the PostgreSQL server package.
....
sudo yum -y install postgresql10-server.x86_64
....

== Docker Environment

As good practice, at this point you'll update your system.
....
sudo yum -y update
....

Now we'll install Docker.
....
sudo yum -y install docker
....

After that, it's necessary to add the *docker* group and give your user access
to that group (here referenced as *someuser*):
....
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker someuser
....

Remember to log out of the *someuser* account for the Docker group
to be added to your current session.  Once it's added, you'll be able
to run Docker commands from your user account.
....
su - someuser
....

You can ensure your *someuser* account is added correctly by running the following
command and ensuring *docker* appears as one of the results:
....
groups
....

Before you start Docker, you might consider configuring Docker storage:
This is described if you run:
....
man docker-storage-setup
....

Follow the instructions available link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/install_config/install/host_preparation.html#configuring-docker-storage[on the main OpenShift documentation page]
to configure Docker storage appropriately.

These steps are illustrative of a typical process for setting up Docker storage. You will need to run these commands as root.

First, add an extra virtual hard disk to your virtual machine (see link:http://catlingmindswipe.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-create-new-virtual-disks-in.html[this blog post] for tips on how to do so).

Run this command to format the drive, where /dev/sd? is the new hard drive that was added:

....
fdisk /dev/sd?
....

Next, create a volume group on the new drive partition within the fdisk utility:

....
vgcreate docker-vg /dev/sd?
....

Then, you'll need to edit the docker-storage-setup configuration file in order to override default options. Add these two lines to **/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup**:

....
DEVS=/dev/sd?
VG=docker-vg
....

Finally, run the command **docker-storage-setup** to use that new volume group. The results should state that the physical volume /dev/sd? and the volume group docker-vg have both been successfully created.

Next, we enable and start up Docker:
....
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl start docker.service
....

Verify that Docker version 1.12.6 was installed, as per the OpenShift 3.6
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/install/host_preparation.html#installing-docker[requirements.]

....
docker version
....

=== Build the Containers

At this point, you have a decision to make - either download prebuilt
containers from link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], *or* build the containers on your local host.

To download the prebuilt containers, make sure you can login to
link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], and then run the following:
....
docker login
cd $CCPROOT
./bin/pull-from-dockerhub.sh
....

Or if you'd rather build the containers from source, perform a container
build as follows:

....
godep restore
cd $CCPROOT
make setup
make all
....

After this, you will have all the Crunchy containers built and are ready
for use in a *standalone Docker* environment.

== Configure Container Storage

The Container Suite is tested on 3 different storage backends:

 * hostPath (single node testing)
 * NFS (single and multi-node testing)
 * Gluster (dynamic storage on separate Gluster cluster)

Other storage backends work as well including GCE, EBS, ScaleIO, and
others but may require you to modify various examples or configuration.

Environment variables are set to determine how and what storage
is to be used.

=== Configure HostPath

HostPath is the simplest storage backend to setup, it only is feasible
on a single node but is good for testing the examples.  In your `.bashrc`
file, add the following variables to specify unique settings to
the hostpath directory:
....
export CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT=""
export CCP_STORAGE_PATH=/data
export CCP_STORAGE_MODE=ReadWriteMany
export CCP_STORAGE_CAPACITY=400M
....

NOTE: It may be necessary to grant your user in OpenShift or Kubernetes the
rights to modify the hostaccess SCC. This can be done with the command: `oadm policy add-scc-to-user hostaccess $(oc whoami)`

=== Configure NFS for Persistence

NFS can also be used as a storage mechanism.  Instructions
on setting up NFS are found at the bottom of this guide.

For testing with NFS, in your *.bashrc* file, include
the following variables that are unique to your NFS environment:
....
export CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT='"supplementalGroups": [65534]"'
export CCP_STORAGE_PATH=/mnt/nfsfileshare
export CCP_NFS_IP=192.168.0.118
export CCP_STORAGE_MODE=ReadWriteMany
export CCP_STORAGE_CAPACITY=400M
....

In this example above the group ownership of the NFS mount is assumed to be
*nfsnobody* or *65534*.

=== Configure Dynamic Storage

Dynamic storage classes can be used for the examples.  Gluster
is only one example of a storage type that supports dynamic storage
classes.

Setting up a Gluster cluster will offer you the ability to use
dynamic storage provisioning in the examples.  A set of example
Gluster configuration files is found at $CCPROOT/docs/gluster.
This configuration is for a 3 node Gluster cluster which runs
on a Centos7 Minimal VM deployment.  See https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/gluster/gluster-setup.adoc

Using block storage requires a security context to be set
as follows:
....
export CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT='"fsGroup":26"'
export CCP_STORAGE_MODE=ReadWriteOnce
export CCP_STORAGE_CAPACITY=400M
....

== OpenShift Environment

See the OpenShift installation guide for details on how to install
OpenShift Enterprise on your host. The main instructions are here:

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/install/quick_install.html

NOTE: If you install OpenShift Enterprise on a server with less than `16GB` memory and `40GB`
of disk, the following Ansible variables need to be added to `~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml`
prior to installation:

....
openshift_check_min_host_disk_gb: '10' # min 10gb disk
openshift_check_min_host_memory_gb: '3' # min 3gb memory
....

== Kubernetes Environment

See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/[kubeadm]
for installing the latest version of Kubernetes.

=== Helm (optional)

Some Kubernetes Helm examples are provided in the following directory as one
option for deploying the Container Suite.

....
$CCPROOT/examples/helm/
....

Once you have your Kubernetes environment configured, it is simple to get
Helm up and running. Please refer to link:https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md[this document]
to get Helm installed and configured properly.

=== DNS

Please see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/[here]
to view the official documentation regarding configuring DNS for your Kubernetes cluster.

===  Tips

Make sure your hostname resolves to a single IP address in your
/etc/hosts file. The NFS examples will not work otherwise and other problems
with installation can occur unless you have a resolving hostname.

You should see a single IP address returned from this command:
....
hostname --ip-address
....

=== NFS Installation

NOTE: Most of the Crunchy containers run as the postgres UID (26), but you
will notice that when *supplementalGroups* are specified, the pod
will include the nfsnobody group in the list of groups for the pod user.

First, if you are running your NFS system with SELinux in enforcing mode, you will need to run the following command to allow NFS write permissions:
....
sudo setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
....

Detailed instructions that you can use for setting up a NFS server on Centos 7 are provided in the following link.

http://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-setup-nfs-server-on-centos-7-rhel-7-fedora-22.html

if you are running your client on a VM, you will need to
add 'insecure' to the exportfs file on the NFS server due to the way port
translation is done between the VM host and the VM instance.

For more details on this bug, please see the following link.

http://serverfault.com/questions/107546/mount-nfs-access-denied-by-server-while-mounting

A suggested best practice for tuning NFS for PostgreSQL is to configure the PostgreSQL fstab
mount options like so:

....
proto=tcp,suid,rw,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,hard,fg,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
....

Network options:
....
MTU=9000
....

If interested in mounting the same NFS share multiple times on the same mount point,
look into the link:https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7010210[noac mount option].
