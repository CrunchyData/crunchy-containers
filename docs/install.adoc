== Project Setup

The crunchy-containers can run on different environments including:

 * *Docker 1.12*
 * *OpenShift Container Platform 3.6*
 * *Kubernetes 1.8+*

In this document we list the basic installation steps required for these
environments.

These installation instructions are developed and tested for the following operating systems:

 * *CentOS 7*
 * *RHEL 7*

=== Project Directory Structure

First add the following lines to your .bashrc file to set
the project paths:
....
export GOPATH=$HOME/cdev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
export CCP_BASEOS=centos7
export CCP_PGVERSION=10
export CCP_PG_FULLVERSION=10.1
export CCP_VERSION=1.7.0
export CCP_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata
export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PG_FULLVERSION-$CCP_VERSION
export CCPROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
export CCP_CLI=kubectl
export NAMESPACE=default
export PV_PATH=/mnt/nfsfileshare
export LOCAL_IP=$(hostname --ip-address)
export REPLACE_CCP_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata
....
It will be necessary to refresh your bashrc file in order for the changes to take
effect.

....
. ~/.bashrc
....

Next, set up a project directory structure and pull down the project:
....
mkdir $HOME/cdev $HOME/cdev/src $HOME/cdev/pkg $HOME/cdev/bin
....

At this point, if you are installing crunchy-containers on a CentOS 7 machine,
you may continue with the following instructions. If you are doing an installation
on RHEL 7, please view the instructions located
link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/install.adoc#rhel-7[below]
that are specific to RHEL environments.

==== CentOS 7
....
cd $GOPATH
sudo yum -y install golang git docker
go get github.com/tools/godep
cd src/github.com
mkdir crunchydata
cd crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
cd crunchy-containers
git checkout 1.7.0
godep restore
....

*If you are a Crunchy enterprise customer, you will place the Crunchy repository
key and yum repository file into the $CCPROOT/conf directory at this point. These
files can be obtained through https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads
page.*

==== RHEL 7

When setting up the environment on RHEL 7, there are slightly different steps that
need to be taken.

....
cd $GOPATH
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
sudo yum -y install git golang docker
go get github.com/tools/godep
cd src/github.com
mkdir crunchydata
cd crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
cd crunchy-containers
git checkout 1.7.0
godep restore
....

*If you are a Crunchy enterprise customer, you will place the Crunchy repository
key and yum repository file into the $CCPROOT/conf directory at this point. These
files can be obtained through https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads
page.*

=== Installing PostgreSQL

These installation instructions assume the installation of PostgreSQL 10
through the official PGDG repository. View the documentation located
link:https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/YUM_Installation[here] in
order to view more detailed notes or install a different version of PostgreSQL.

Locate and edit your distributions .repo file, located:

 * On CentOS: /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo, [base] and [updates] sections
 * On Red Hat: /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf [main] section

To the section(s) identified above, you need to append a line (otherwise
dependencies might resolve to the PostgreSQL supplied by the base repository):

....
exclude=postgresql*
....

Next, install the RPM relating to the base operating system and PostgreSQL version
you wish to install. The RPMs can be found link:https://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php[here].

For example, to install PostgreSQL 10 on a CentOS 7 system:
....
sudo yum -y install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/10/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos10-10-2.noarch.rpm
....

Or to install PostgreSQL 10 on a RHEL 7 system:
....
sudo yum -y install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/testing/10/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat10-10-2.noarch.rpm
....

You'll need to update your system:
....
sudo yum -y update
....

Then, go ahead and install the PostgreSQL server package.
....
sudo yum -y install postgresql10-server.x86_64
....

=== Docker Environment

As good practice, at this point you'll update your system.
....
sudo yum -y update
....

After that, it's necessary to add the *docker* group and give your user access
to that group (here referenced as *someuser*):
....
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker someuser
....

Remember to log out of the *someuser* account for the Docker group
to be added to your current session.  Once it's added, you'll be able
to run Docker commands from your user account.
....
su - someuser
....

You can ensure your *someuser* account is added correctly by running the following
command and ensuring *docker* appears as one of the results:
....
groups
....

Before you start Docker, you might consider configuring Docker storage:
This is described if you run:
....
man docker-storage-setup
....

Follow the instructions available link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/install_config/install/host_preparation.html#configuring-docker-storage[on the main OpenShift documentation page]
to configure Docker storage appropriately.

These steps are illustrative of a typical process for setting up Docker storage. You will need to run these commands as root.

First, add an extra virtual hard disk to your virtual machine (see link:http://catlingmindswipe.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-create-new-virtual-disks-in.html[this blog post] for tips on how to do so).

Run this command to format the drive, where /dev/sd? is the new hard drive that was added:

....
fdisk /dev/sd?
....

Next, create a volume group on the new drive partition within the fdisk utility:

....
vgcreate docker-vg /dev/sd?
....

Then, you'll need to edit the docker-storage-setup configuration file in order to override default options. Add these two lines to **/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup**:

....
DEVS=/dev/sd?
VG=docker-vg
....

Finally, run the command **docker-storage-setup** to use that new volume group. The results should state that the physical volume /dev/sd? and the volume group docker-vg have both been successfully created.

Next, we enable and start up Docker:
....
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl start docker.service
....

Verify that Docker version 1.12.6 was installed, as per the OpenShift 3.6
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/install/host_preparation.html#installing-docker[requirements.]

....
docker version
....

=== Build the Containers

At this point, you have a decision to make - either download prebuilt
containers from link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], *or* build the containers on your local host.

To download the prebuilt containers, make sure you can login to
link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], and then run the following:
....
docker login
cd $CCPROOT
./bin/pull-from-dockerhub.sh
....

Or if you'd rather build the containers from source, perform a container
build as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT
make setup
make all
....

After this, you will have all the Crunchy containers built and are ready
for use in a *standalone Docker* environment.

=== Configure NFS for Persistence

NFS is required for some of the examples, including the backup and restore
containers.

First, if you are running your NFS system with SELinux in enforcing mode, you will need to run the following command to allow NFS write permissions:
....
sudo setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
....

Detailed instructions that you can use for setting up a NFS server on Centos 7 are provided in the following link.

http://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-setup-nfs-server-on-centos-7-rhel-7-fedora-22.html

*Note*: Most of the Crunchy containers run as the postgres UID (26), but you
will notice that when *supplementalGroups* are specified, the pod
will include the nfsnobody group in the list of groups for the pod user.

The case of Amazon file systems is different, for that you use the
*fsGroup* security context setting but the idea for allowing
write permissions is the same.

if you are running your client on a VM, you will need to
add 'insecure' to the exportfs file on the NFS server due to the way port
translation is done between the VM host and the VM instance.

For more details on this bug, please see the following link.

http://serverfault.com/questions/107546/mount-nfs-access-denied-by-server-while-mounting

A suggested best practice for tuning NFS for PostgreSQL is to configure the PostgreSQL fstab
mount options like so:

....
proto=tcp,suid,rw,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,hard,fg,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
....

Network options:
....
MTU=9000
....

If interested in mounting the same NFS share multiple times on the same mount point,
look into the link:https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7010210[noac mount option].

Next, assuming that you are setting up NFS as your storage option, you
will need to run the following script:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/pv
./create-pv.sh nfs
./create-pvc.sh
....

*Note*: If you elect to configure HostPath or GCE as your storage option, please view
README.txt for command-line usage for the ./create-pv.sh command.

== OpenShift Environment

=== Installation

See the OpenShift installation guide for details on how to install
OpenShift Enterprise on your host. The main instructions are here:

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/install/quick_install.html

*Note:* If you install OpenShift Enterprise on a server with less than `16GB` memory and `40GB`
of disk, the following Ansible variables need to be added to `~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml`
prior to installation:

....
openshift_check_min_host_disk_gb: '10' # min 10gb disk
openshift_check_min_host_memory_gb: '3' # min 3gb memory
....

If you are using OpenShift Origin, the installation instructions for *oc cluster up*
can be found link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md[here].

==== System policies for PVC creation/listing

In order to allow the *system* user to be able to create and list
persistent volumes using *OpenShift version 3.3+*, you have to enter
these commands as the *root* user after installation in order to
modify the policies.
....
oc adm policy add-role-to-user cluster-reader system
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader system
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system
....

=== anyuid permissions

One suggested method to use in order to grant a user permission to use the *anyuid* SCC:
....
oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:authenticated
....

This says that any authenticated user can run with the anyuid SCC which lets
them create PVCs and use the *fsGroup* setting for the PostgreSQL containers to
work using NFS.

== Kubernetes Environment

=== Installation

See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/[kubeadm]
for setting up a test environment of Kubernetes.

=== Helm

*Installation*

Once you have your Kubernetes environment configured, it is simple to get
Helm up and running. Please refer to link:https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-kubernetes/#step-4-install-helm-and-tiller[this document]
to get Helm installed and configured properly.

=== Permissions

As of Kubernetes 1.6, RBAC security is enabled on most Kubernetes
installations.  With RBAC, the *postgres-operator* needs permissions
granted to it to enable ThirdPartyResources viewing.  You can grant the
*default* Service Account a cluster role as one way to enable
permissions for the operator. This coarse level of granting permissions
is not recommended for production. This command will enable
the *default* Service Account to have the *cluster-admin* role:
....
kubectl create clusterrolebinding permissive-binding \
	--clusterrole=cluster-admin \
	--user=admin \
	--user=kubelet \
       	--group=system:serviceaccounts:default
....

=== DNS

Please see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/[here]
to view the official documentation regarding configuring DNS for your Kubernetes cluster.

=== Google Cloud Environment

The PostgreSQL Container Suite was tested on Google Container Engine.

Here is a link to set up a Kube cluster on GCE:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/gce

Setup the persistent disks using GCE disks by first editing
your *bashrc* file and export the GCE settings to match your
GCE environment.

....
export GCE_DISK_ZONE=us-central1-a
export GCE_DISK_NAME=gce-disk-crunchy
export GCE_DISK_SIZE=4
export GCE_FS_FORMAT=ext4
....

Then create the PVs used by the examples, passing in the *gce*
value as a parameter. This will cause the GCE disks to be created:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/pv
./create-pv.sh gce
cd $CCPROOT/examples/pv
./create-pvc.sh
....

Here is a link that describes more information on GCE persistent disk:
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/tutorials/persistent-disk/


To have the persistent disk examples work, you will need to specify
a *fsGroup* setting in the *SecurityContext* of each pod script
as follows:
....
       "securityContext": {
        "fsGroup": 26
        },
....

For our PostgreSQL container, a UID of 26 is specified as the user
which corresponds to the *fsGroup* value.

===  Tips

Make sure your hostname resolves to a single IP address in your
/etc/hosts file. The NFS examples will not work otherwise and other problems
with installation can occur unless you have a resolving hostname.

You should see a single IP address returned from this command:
....
hostname --ip-address
....
