== Project Setup & Docker Installation

The crunchy-containers can run on different environments including:

 * Docker
 * OpenShift 3.3+
 * Kubernetes 1.2+

In this document we list the basic installation steps required for these
environments.

These installation instructions are developed and tested for the following operating systems:

 * CentOS 7
 * RHEL 7

=== Step 1 - Project Directory Structure

First add the following lines to your .bashrc file to set
the project paths:
....
export GOPATH=$HOME/cdev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
export CCP_BASEOS=centos7
export CCP_PGVERSION=9.6
export CCP_VERSION=1.5
export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PGVERSION-$CCP_VERSION
export CCPROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
....
It will be necessary to log out and back in for the changes to your .bashrc
file to take effect.

Next, set up a project directory structure and pull down the project:
....
mkdir $HOME/cdev $HOME/cdev/src $HOME/cdev/pkg $HOME/cdev/bin
cd $GOPATH
sudo yum -y install golang git docker postgresql
go get github.com/tools/godep
cd src/github.com
mkdir crunchydata
cd crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
cd crunchy-containers
git checkout 1.5
godep restore
....

*If you are a Crunchy enterprise customer, you will place the CRUNCHY repo
key and yum repo file into the $CCPROOT/conf directory at this point. These
files can be obtained through https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads
page.*

=== Step 2 - Install the Host Dependencies

As good practice, at this point you'll update your system.
....
sudo yum -y update
....

After that, it's necessary to add the *docker* group and give your user access
to that group (here referenced as *someuser*):
....
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker someuser
....

Remember to log out of the *someuser* account for the Docker group
to be added to your current session.  Once it's added, you'll be able
to run Docker commands from your user account.
....
su - someuser
....

You can ensure your *someuser* account is added correctly by running the following
command and ensuring *docker* appears as one of the results:
....
groups
....

Before you start Docker, you might consider configuring Docker storage:
This is described if you run:
....
man docker-storage-setup
....

Follow the instructions available link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/install_config/install/host_preparation.html#configuring-docker-storage[on the main OpenShift documentation page]
to configure Docker storage appropriately.

These steps are illustrative of a typical process for setting up Docker storage. You will need to run these commands as root.

First, add an extra virtual hard disk to your virtual machine (see link:http://catlingmindswipe.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-create-new-virtual-disks-in.html[this blog post] for tips on how to do so).

Run this command to format the drive, where /dev/sd? is the new hard drive that was added:

....
fdisk /dev/sd?
....

Next, create a volume group on the new drive partition within the fdisk utility:

....
vgcreate docker-vg /dev/sd?
....

Then, you'll need to edit the docker-storage-setup configuration file in order to override default options. Add these two lines to **/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup**:

....
DEVS=/dev/sd?
VG=docker-vg
....

Finally, run the command **docker-storage-setup** to use that new volume group. The results should state that the physical volume /dev/sd? and the volume group docker-vg have both been successfully created.

Next, we enable and start up Docker:
....
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl start docker.service
....

=== Step 3 - Build the Containers

At this point, you have a decision to make - either download prebuilt
containers from link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], *or* build the containers on your local host.

To download the prebuilt containers, make sure you can login to
link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], and then run the following:
....
docker login
cd $CCPROOT
./bin/pull-from-dockerhub.sh
....

Or if you'd rather build the containers from source, perform a container
build as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT
make setup
make all
....

After this, you will have all the Crunchy containers built and are ready
for use in a *standalone Docker* environment.

== OpenShift Environment

=== Installation

See the OpenShift installation guide for details on how to install
OpenShift Enterprise on your host.  The main instructions are here:

https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/install_config/install/index.html

For testing purposes, OpenShift Origin is the simplest to install and configure. The
easiest way to get OpenShift Origin up and running is through the link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md[oc cluster up] cluster configuration.

For examples and tips on how to run OpenShift Enterprise & Origin, please look
at the link:https://github.com/xenophenes/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/examples.adoc[Examples Documentation].

=== Configure NFS for Persistence

NFS is required for some of the OpenShift examples, including the backup and restore
containers.

First, if you are running your NFS system with SELinux in enforcing mode, you will need to run the following command
to allow NFS write permissions:
....
sudo setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
....

The necessary dependencies will need to be installed and started next:
....
sudo setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
sudo yum -y install nfs-utils libnfsidmap
sudo systemctl enable rpcbind nfs-server
sudo systemctl start rpcbind nfs-server rpc-statd nfs-idmapd
....

You will then need to set the permissions of your NFS
path so that your pods can have write access.  For the
Crunchy examples, the *nfsnobody* GUI was chosen as
an example.  Pods will reference the *nfsnobody* GID (65534)
as a security context *supplementalGroup* attribute.  This
setting will allow the pod to have group permissions of 65534
and therefore be able to write to the NFS persistent volumes.

The permissions on the NFS path are set as follows:
....
sudo mkdir /nfsfileshare
sudo chmod 777 /nfsfileshare
....

Most of the Crunchy containers run as the postgres UID (26), but you
will notice that when *supplementalGroups* are specified, the pod
will include the nfsnobody group in the list of groups for the pod user.

The case of Amazon file systems is different, for that you use the
*fsGroup* security context setting but the idea for allowing
write permissions is the same.

You will then need to modify the /etc/exports file.
....
sudo vi /etc/exports
....

The /etc/exports file should contain a line similar to this one except with the applicable IP address specified:
....
/nfsfileshare 192.168.122.9(rw,sync)
....

After saving and closing the file, you will need to re-export all directories:
....
sudo exportfs -r
....

Detailed instructions that you can use for setting up a NFS server on Centos 7 are provided in the following link.

http://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-setup-nfs-server-on-centos-7-rhel-7-fedora-22.html

OpenShift NFS examples can be found here:

https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/wordpress/nfs

The examples specify a test NFS server running at IP address 192.168.0.103.

On that server, the /etc/exports file looks like this:
....
/nfsfileshare *(rw,sync)
....

Test your NFS configuration out by mounting a local directory:
....
mount 192.168.0.114:/nfsfileshare /mnt/nfsfileshare
....

if you are running your client on a VM, you will need to
add 'insecure' to the exportfs file on the NFS server, this is because
of the way port translation is done between the VM host and the VM instance.

For more details on this bug, please see the following link.

http://serverfault.com/questions/107546/mount-nfs-access-denied-by-server-while-mounting

A suggested best practice for tuning NFS for PostgreSQL is to configure the PostgreSQL fstab
mount options like so:

....
proto=tcp,suid,rw,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,hard,fg,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
....

Network options:
....
MTU=9000
....

If interested in mounting the same NFS share multiple times on the same mount point,
look into the link:https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7010210[noac mount option].

=== Persistent Volume Claims

For running the examples that require persistent volumes, you
will need to run the following script:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/pv
./create-pv.sh
./create-pvc.sh
....

View the README.txt for command-line usage.

== Kubernetes Environment

=== Installation

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/[kubeadm] or link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/[minikube] are simple methods
for setting up a test environment of Kubernetes.

See the following links for installation instructions:

 * https://github.com/Kubernetes/minikube
 * http://linoxide.com/containers/setup-kubernetes-kubeadm-centos/
 * https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/

=== Examples

The namespace is set for the examples within the *examples/envvars.sh* script
and defaults to *default*.  Set this variable according to your
project configuration.

Note, some of the examples assume an NFS file system for creating
persistent volumes.  See above for details on setting NFS permissions and
the use of *supplementalGroups* within pod specs.

Visit the link:examples.adoc[examples documentation] for different use cases
and examples.

=== Minishift Configuration

If you are wanting to run the examples on a Minishift instance
you will need to create the PVs using hostPath as follows:
....
oc login -u system:admin
./create-pv.sh hostpath
oc login -u developer
./create-pvc.sh
....

Additional steps are required to allow persistence to work
on Minishift including:
....
oc login -u system:admin
oc edit scc restricted
....

Above, you will change runAsUser.Type strategy to RunAsAny.

On the boot2docker instance running Minishift, you will need
to set the host path permissions as follows:
....
chmod 777 /mnt/sda1/data
....

The NAMESPACE environment variable is set to indicate which OpenShift
project you want various example objects to use.  This variable
is set to *default* within the *examples/envvars.sh* script.  Set this
to match your project configuration.

See link:examples.adoc[here] to view the documentation showing various
examples.

===  Tips

Make sure your hostname resolves to a single IP address in your
/etc/hosts file!  If not, the NFS examples will not work.

You should see a single IP address returned from this command:
....
hostname --ip-address
....

....
sudo PATH=$PATH ALLOW_PRIVILEGED=true ./hack/local-up-cluster.sh
....

Note:  specifying ALLOW_PRIVILEGED=true is required if you are running
in SELinux enforcing mode. This allows you to specify the following
in your pod spec to run the container as privileged:
....
"securityContext": {
	"privileged": true
},
....
