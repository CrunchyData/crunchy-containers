== Project Setup & Docker Installation

The crunchy-containers can run on different environments including:

 * Docker
 * OpenShift Enterprise
 * OpenShift Origin
 * Kubernetes 1.2+
 * Helm

In this document we list the basic installation steps required for these
environments.

These installation instructions are developed and tested for the following operating systems:

 * *CentOS 7*
 * *RHEL 7*

=== Step 1 - Project Directory Structure

First add the following lines to your .bashrc file to set
the project paths:
....
export GOPATH=$HOME/cdev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
export CCP_BASEOS=centos7
export CCP_PGVERSION=10
export CCP_PG_FULLVERSION=10.0
export CCP_VERSION=1.6.0
export CCP_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata
export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PG_FULLVERSION-$CCP_VERSION
export CCPROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
export CCP_CLI=kubectl
export NAMESPACE=default
export PV_PATH=/mnt/nfsfileshare
export LOCAL_IP=$(hostname --ip-address)
export REPLACE_CCP_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata
....
It will be necessary to log out and back in for the changes to your .bashrc
file to take effect.

Next, set up a project directory structure and pull down the project:
....
mkdir $HOME/cdev $HOME/cdev/src $HOME/cdev/pkg $HOME/cdev/bin
cd $GOPATH
sudo yum -y install golang git docker postgresql-server
go get github.com/tools/godep
cd src/github.com
mkdir crunchydata
cd crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
cd crunchy-containers
git checkout 1.6.0
godep restore
....

*If you are a Crunchy enterprise customer, you will place the CRUNCHY repo
key and yum repo file into the $CCPROOT/conf directory at this point. These
files can be obtained through https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads
page.*

=== Step 2 - Install the Host Dependencies

As good practice, at this point you'll update your system.
....
sudo yum -y update
....

After that, it's necessary to add the *docker* group and give your user access
to that group (here referenced as *someuser*):
....
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker someuser
....

Remember to log out of the *someuser* account for the Docker group
to be added to your current session.  Once it's added, you'll be able
to run Docker commands from your user account.
....
su - someuser
....

You can ensure your *someuser* account is added correctly by running the following
command and ensuring *docker* appears as one of the results:
....
groups
....

Before you start Docker, you might consider configuring Docker storage:
This is described if you run:
....
man docker-storage-setup
....

Follow the instructions available link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/install_config/install/host_preparation.html#configuring-docker-storage[on the main OpenShift documentation page]
to configure Docker storage appropriately.

These steps are illustrative of a typical process for setting up Docker storage. You will need to run these commands as root.

First, add an extra virtual hard disk to your virtual machine (see link:http://catlingmindswipe.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-create-new-virtual-disks-in.html[this blog post] for tips on how to do so).

Run this command to format the drive, where /dev/sd? is the new hard drive that was added:

....
fdisk /dev/sd?
....

Next, create a volume group on the new drive partition within the fdisk utility:

....
vgcreate docker-vg /dev/sd?
....

Then, you'll need to edit the docker-storage-setup configuration file in order to override default options. Add these two lines to **/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup**:

....
DEVS=/dev/sd?
VG=docker-vg
....

Finally, run the command **docker-storage-setup** to use that new volume group. The results should state that the physical volume /dev/sd? and the volume group docker-vg have both been successfully created.

Next, we enable and start up Docker:
....
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl start docker.service
....

=== Step 3 - Build the Containers

At this point, you have a decision to make - either download prebuilt
containers from link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], *or* build the containers on your local host.

To download the prebuilt containers, make sure you can login to
link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], and then run the following:
....
docker login
cd $CCPROOT
./bin/pull-from-dockerhub.sh
....

Or if you'd rather build the containers from source, perform a container
build as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT
make setup
make all
....

After this, you will have all the Crunchy containers built and are ready
for use in a *standalone Docker* environment.

=== Step 4 - Configure NFS for Persistence

NFS is required for some of the examples, including the backup and restore
containers.

First, if you are running your NFS system with SELinux in enforcing mode, you will need to run the following command to allow NFS write permissions:
....
sudo setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
....

Detailed instructions that you can use for setting up a NFS server on Centos 7 are provided in the following link.

http://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-setup-nfs-server-on-centos-7-rhel-7-fedora-22.html

*Note*: Most of the Crunchy containers run as the postgres UID (26), but you
will notice that when *supplementalGroups* are specified, the pod
will include the nfsnobody group in the list of groups for the pod user.

The case of Amazon file systems is different, for that you use the
*fsGroup* security context setting but the idea for allowing
write permissions is the same.

if you are running your client on a VM, you will need to
add 'insecure' to the exportfs file on the NFS server due to the way port
translation is done between the VM host and the VM instance.

For more details on this bug, please see the following link.

http://serverfault.com/questions/107546/mount-nfs-access-denied-by-server-while-mounting

A suggested best practice for tuning NFS for PostgreSQL is to configure the PostgreSQL fstab
mount options like so:

....
proto=tcp,suid,rw,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,hard,fg,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
....

Network options:
....
MTU=9000
....

If interested in mounting the same NFS share multiple times on the same mount point,
look into the link:https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7010210[noac mount option].

Next, assuming that you are setting up NFS as your storage option, you
will need to run the following script:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/pv
./create-pv.sh nfs
./create-pvc.sh
....

*Note*: If you elect to configure HostPath or GCE as your storage option, please view
README.txt for command-line usage for the ./create-pv.sh command.

== OpenShift Environment

=== Installation

See the OpenShift installation guide for details on how to install
OpenShift Enterprise on your host.  The main instructions are here:

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/install/quick_install.html

For testing purposes, OpenShift Origin is the simplest to install and configure. The
easiest way to get OpenShift Origin up and running is through the link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md[oc cluster up] cluster configuration.

For examples and tips on how to run OpenShift Enterprise & Origin, please look
at the link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/examples.adoc[Examples Documentation].

==== System policies for PVC creation/listing

In order to allow the *system* user to be able to create and list
persistent volumes using *OpenShift version 3.3+*, you have to enter
these commands as the *root* user after installation in order to
modify the policies.
....
oadm policy add-role-to-user cluster-reader system
oc describe clusterPolicyBindings :default
oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader system
oc describe clusterPolicyBindings :default
oc describe clusterPolicyBindings :default
oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system
....

==== Persistent volume matching

Restoring a database from an NFS backup requires the building
of a PV which maps to the NFS backup archive path.  For example,
if you have a backup at /backups/pg-foo/2016-01-29:22:34:20
then we create a PV that maps to that NFS path.  We also use
a "label" on the PV so that the specific backup PV can be identified.

We use the pod name in the label value to make the PV unique.  This
way, the related PVC can find the right PV to map to and not some other
PV.  In the PVC, we specify the same "label" which lets Kubernetes
match to the correct PV.

=== anyuid permissions

One suggested method to use in order to grant a user permission to use the *anyuid* SCC:
....
oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:authenticated
....

This says that any authenticated user can run with the anyuid SCC which lets
them create PVCs and use the *fsGroup* setting for the PostgreSQL containers to
work using NFS.

=== DNS Configuration

==== DNS host entry

If your OpenShift environment can not resolve your hostname via
a DNS server (external to OpenShift!), you will get errors when trying
to create a DeploymentConfig.

Because of this, it is advisable to either install dnsmasq
and reconfigure OpenShift, or run a DNS server on another host and add
the OpenShift host entry to that DNS server. The *skybridge2* Docker
container is sufficient for this purpose.

*Note*: Remember to adjust your /etc/resolv.conf to specify the new DNS
server.

==== OpenShift v3

The following DNS modifications are necessary for versions prior to OpenShift Enterprise 3.3.

Luke Meyer from Redhat wrote an excellent blog on how to configure dnsmasq and OpenShift;
this is available link:http://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/11/19/dns-your-openshift-v3-cluster/[here].

Key things included in this blog are how to:

 * Configure DHCP to include the local IP address in /etc/resolv.conf upon boot
 * Configure dnsmasq
 * Configure OpenShift DNS to listen on another port

A sample setup would typically have the following IP addresses/ports configured:

 * OpenShift DNS listening on 127.0.0.1:8053
 * dnsmasq listening on the local IP address 192.168.0.109:53

Therefore in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf it is necessary to append the following line in
this sample setup:

....
prepend domain-name-servers 192.168.0.109;
....

If you don't have your DNS configured correctly, replication controllers
and deployment configurations will not work as expected.

==== OpenShift Origin

The official instructions for configuring DNS on your OpenShift Origin cluster can be
found link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/install/prerequisites.html#prereq-dns[here].

== Kubernetes Environment

=== Installation

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/[kubeadm] or link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/[minikube] are simple methods
for setting up a test environment of Kubernetes.

See the following links for installation instructions:

 * https://github.com/Kubernetes/minikube
 * http://linoxide.com/containers/setup-kubernetes-kubeadm-centos/
 * https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/

=== Examples

The namespace is set for the examples within your *bashrc* file; if you followed the
installation instructions exactly, this will be set to *default*. Set this variable according to your
project configuration.

Note, some of the examples assume an NFS file system for creating
persistent volumes.  See above for details on setting NFS permissions and
the use of *supplementalGroups* within pod specs.

Visit the link:examples.adoc[examples documentation] for different use cases
and examples.

=== Minishift Configuration

If you are wanting to run the examples on a Minishift instance
you will need to create the PVs using hostPath as follows:
....
oc login -u system:admin
./create-pv.sh hostpath
oc login -u developer
./create-pvc.sh
....

Additional steps are required to allow persistence to work
on Minishift including:
....
oc login -u system:admin
oc edit scc restricted
....

Above, you will change runAsUser.Type strategy to RunAsAny.

On the boot2docker instance running Minishift, you will need
to set the host path permissions as follows:
....
chmod 777 /mnt/sda1/data
....

The NAMESPACE environment variable is set to indicate which OpenShift
project you want various example objects to use.  This variable
is set to *default* within your *bashrc* file if you followed the installation
instructions exactly. Set this to match your project configuration.

See link:examples.adoc[here] to view the documentation showing various
examples.

=== Helm

*Installation*

Once you have your Kubernetes environment configured, it is simple to get
Helm up and running. Please refer to link:https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-kubernetes/#step-4-install-helm-and-tiller[this document]
to get Helm installed and configured properly.

=== Permissions

As of Kubernetes 1.6, RBAC security is enabled on most Kubernetes
installations.  With RBAC, the *postgres-operator* needs permissions
granted to it to enable ThirdPartyResources viewing.  You can grant the
*default* Service Account a cluster role as one way to enable
permissions for the operator. This coarse level of granting permissions
is not recommended for production. This command will enable
the *default* Service Account to have the *cluster-admin* role:
....
kubectl create clusterrolebinding permissive-binding \
	--clusterrole=cluster-admin \
	--user=admin \
	--user=kubelet \
       	--group=system:serviceaccounts:default
....

=== DNS

Please see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/[here]
to view the official documentation regarding configuring DNS for your Kubernetes cluster.

===  Tips

Make sure your hostname resolves to a single IP address in your
/etc/hosts file!  If not, the NFS examples will not work.

You should see a single IP address returned from this command:
....
hostname --ip-address
....

....
sudo PATH=$PATH ALLOW_PRIVILEGED=true ./hack/local-up-cluster.sh
....

Note:  specifying ALLOW_PRIVILEGED=true is required if you are running
in SELinux enforcing mode. This allows you to specify the following
in your pod spec to run the container as privileged:
....
"securityContext": {
	"privileged": true
},
....
