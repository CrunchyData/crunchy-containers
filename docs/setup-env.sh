printf "Now time to create Docker storage hard disk...\n"
printf "(1) Add new hard disk via VirtualBox.\n"
printf "(2) Run this command to format the drive, where /dev/sd? is the new hard drive that was added:\n fdisk /dev/sd?\n\n"
printf "Next, create a volume group on the new drive partition within the fdisk utility:\n vgcreate docker-vg /dev/sd?\n\n"
printf "Then, youâ€™ll need to edit the docker-storage-setup configuration file in order to override default options. Add these two lines to /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup:\n DEVS=/dev/sd?\n VG=docker-vg\n\n"
printf "Finally, run the command docker-storage-setup to use that new volume group. The results should state that the physical volume /dev/sd? and the volume group docker-vg have both been successfully created."
printf "Next, we enable and start up Docker:\n sudo systemctl enable docker.service\nsudo systemctl start docker.service\n\n"
printf "After that, you should only need to set up your DNS service if necessary and you will then be complete with your initial environment setup! Note: oc and kubectl will need to be installed separately."
