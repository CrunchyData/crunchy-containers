v1.8.2, {docdate}


== Prerequisites

You will need to do the following steps prior to testing.

*Note*: If version numbers have not been updated, you will need update version numbers in documentation and examples in your test instance.

It is recommended to build a clean virtual machine for all three applications (Docker, OpenShift, Kubernetes) on both operating systems (CentOS 7, RHEL 7).
This will ensure the most accurate results from testing.

Installation instructions are located link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/install.adoc[here] in the officially
supported installation document for the containers suite. In the document, you will find instructions on prerequisites for the environment, setting
up your machines, and external links for installing Docker, OpenShift and Kubernetes.

If you wanted a more automated way of setting these up, a bash script has been provided in the /docs directory, link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/all-in-one/all-in-one.adoc[all-in-one]. Ensure the script has the proper version numbers for what you are testing before running the script. This will set up an environment with all the necessary prerequisites.

CentOS 7:

 * Build a clean Docker CentOS 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean OpenShift CentOS 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean Kubernetes CentOS 7 host (VM)

RHEL 7:

 * Build a clean Docker RHEL 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean OpenShift RHEL 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean Kubernetes RHEL 7 host (VM)

At this point, you can build the 9.5, 9.6 and 10 images on all three hosts. (Or if you're testing a new PostgreSQL release, you can build those at this point also.)

 * Build the 9.5, 9.6, and 10 images on the new Docker host
 * Build the 9.5, 9.6, and 10 images on the new OpenShift host
 * Build the 9.5, 9.6, and 10 images on the new Kubernetes host

There are three other environments that we offer: Helm, Mesos, and Docker-Compose. The following containers need to be tested in those environments:

Mesos:
 * primary-replica

Docker-Compose:
 * primary-replica

Helm:
 * basic
 * primary-replica
 * statefulset

== Container Release Testing

The following examples are used to test each environment. This applies to whether you're testing a new PostgreSQL release or a new Container Suite release.

For each container, a link is added below that corresponds to the link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/examples.adoc[Examples Documentation]. Follow the steps for each, and verify that everything is running successfully.
