== Description

The PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL GIS containers can enable an SSH daemon to allow developers 
to do DBA tasks on the database server without the need for exec privileges.  An administrator 
who deploys the SSHD enabled PostgreSQL database can specify the authorized public keys for 
access to the database server.

This document describes what is needed to activate SSHD in the PostgreSQL containers.

=== SSHD Configuration 

In order to activate SSHD in the PostgreSQL containers, the following files need to be 
mounted to the PostgreSQL container:

- SSH Host keys mounted on the /sshd volume. Three keys are required:

  * ssh_host_rsa_key
  * ssh_host_ecdsa_key
  * ssh_host_ed25519_key
  
- sshd_config mounted on the /pgconf volume
- authorized_keys mounted on the /pgconf volume

SSHD can be enabled in the PostgreSQL containers by adding the following 

....
ENABLE_SSHD=true
....

The *authorized_keys* file is mounted on the */pgconf* directory.  In order to support 
using this mount for authentication the following must be set in *sshd_config*:

....
AuthorizedKeysFile /pgconf/authorized_keys
StrictModes no
....

For OpenShift deployments, the following configuration needs to be set in *sshd_config*:

....
UsePAM no
....

=== Running the Examples

==== Docker

Start the example as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/postgres-sshd
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Docker environment:

 * A volume named pgconf which contains the pgbackrest.conf, pg_hba.conf, postgresql.conf, sshd_config, authorized_keys file
 * A volume named sshd containing the SSH Host keys
 * postgres-sshd container pgbackrest archive and sshd enabled. An initial stanza db will be created on initialization

After running the example, SSH to the container using the forwarded port 2022:

....
ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@0.0.0.0
....

==== Kubernetes

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/postgres-sshd
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:

 * A configMap named pgconf which contains the pgbackrest.conf, pg_hba.conf, postgresql.conf, sshd_config, authorized_keys file
 * A secret named sshd-secrets containing the SSH Host keys
 * postgres-sshd pod with pgbackrest archive and sshd enabled. An initial stanza db will be created on initialization
 * postgres-sshd service with port 2022 for SSH

After running the example, SSH to the service using the postgres-sshd service available in Kubernetes:

....
ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@postgres-sshd
....

==== OpenShift

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/postgres-sshd
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:

 * A configMap named pgconf which contains the pgbackrest.conf, pg_hba.conf, postgresql.conf, sshd_config, authorized_keys file
 * A secret named sshd-secrets containing the SSH Host keys
 * postgres-sshd pod with pgbackrest archive and sshd enabled. An initial stanza db will be created on initialization
 * postgres-sshd service with port 2022 for SSH

After running the example, SSH to the service using the postgres-sshd service available in OpenShift:

....
ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@postgres-sshd
....

==== Using pgBackrest via SSH 

If a pgbackrest.conf file is located on the /pgconf volume and archiving is enabled, it's possible to 
run backups using the pgBackrest utility.

With the SSHD service running, the following command will issue a pgBackrest backup:

....
ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@postgres-sshd pgbackrest --stanza=db backup
....

To list all the available pgBackrest backups, run the following:

....
ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@postgres-sshd pgbackrest info
....
