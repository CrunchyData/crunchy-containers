== OpenShift Dedicated Environment

Here are instructions for running examples on an OpenShift 3.4 Dedicated
environment.  For Dedicated, we have built a set of templates
that can be installed into a Dedicated instance to help automate
the creation of Crunchy Container Suite containers.

A defined set of templates are supported including:

 * primary database
 * replica database
 * full database backup
 * database restore
 * pgadmin4

Each template is described below.

There are some limitations presented by OpenShift 3.4 in the way
in which we can scale up the replica databases.  Without support
for dynamic volume provisioning and stateful sets, the replica
databases can be scaled in a more manual way by creating a new
replica database using the provided template.  If you want say
3 replica databases, you would use the template 3 times to create
the 3 replicas.

When OpenShift supports StatefulSets and Dynamic Provisioning, the
replica can be included within a Deployment and/or StatefulSet which
will allow for scaling to be done by manipulating the Replica Count
within the Deployment or StatefulSet.

== Installation

Users can install the templates into their OpenShift environment
using the following commands.

First, add the following lines to your .bashrc file to set
the project paths:
....
export GOPATH=$HOME/cdev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
export CCP_BASEOS=centos7
export CCP_PGVERSION=9.6
export CCP_PG_FULLVERSION=9.6.5
export CCP_VERSION=1.6.0
export CCP_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata
export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PG_FULLVERSION-$CCP_VERSION
export CCPROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
....
You will then need to log out and back in for the changes to your .bashrc
file to take effect.

Next, set up a project directory structure and pull down the project:
....
mkdir $HOME/cdev $HOME/cdev/src $HOME/cdev/pkg $HOME/cdev/bin
cd $GOPATH
sudo yum -y install golang git docker postgresql
go get github.com/tools/godep
cd src/github.com
mkdir crunchydata
cd crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
cd crunchy-containers
git checkout 1.5
godep restore
....

Finally, you'll change directories to your Dedicated examples repository and create all the templates stored there.
....
cd crunchy-containers/examples/dedicated
./create-all.sh
....

=== Example Details

Each example will build a template to be later used by
users when they want to deploy a Crunchy container.

The templates are installed by running the following script
within each example directory:

....
./run.sh
....

When you run the examples, there are variable substitutions taking
place to set the image path and image tags within the OpenShift
templates.  This substitution allows for better support of different
deployments and deployment environments.

You can either use the templates within the OpenShift Web Console
using the *Add to Project* functionality or use the *oc* CLI locally
to use the templates to deploy databases.

Within each template directory, there is an *example.sh* script
that shows how to use the template using the *oc* CLI.

=== Deploying Images to OpenShift Registry

You can deploy the Crunchy built container images to the OpenShift
registry by running the following script:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/dedicated
./push-images.sh
....

You will first need to login to the OpenShift registry to perform
this script.

The script will create the appropriate image tag and push the image to the
remote registry.

*If you are a Crunchy enterprise customer, you will need to change the $TOKEN and $REG
values in the push-images.sh script to the ones that correspond to your company's registries
along with your personal access token. The necessary token and server information can be
obtained either through the web console (console.$YOURCOMPANY.openshift.com) or by visiting
your company's API server and requesting a token
(https://api.$YOURCOMPANY.openshift.com/oath/token/request).*

As you use the templates, you can specify the images in your templates using the OpenShift
registry URL as follows for the *default* OpenShift project:
....
172.30.149.135:5000/default
....

== Containers Used

=== crunchy-postgres container

The crunchy-postgres container executes the Postgres database.

*Packages*

The container image is built using either the Crunchy Postgres release
or the community version based upon a flag in the Makefile.

The Crunchy Postgres RPMs are available to Crunchy customers only.  The
Crunchy release is meant for customers that require enterprise level
support.

The PGDG community RPMs can be used as well by simply commenting out
the Crunchy yum repo within the Dockerfiles and uncommenting
the PGDG yum repo.

*setup.sql*

The *setup.sql* script is used to define startup SQL commands that are
executed when the database is first created.

*Environment Variables*

 * PG_MODE - either *primary*, *replica* or *set*, this value determines whether
   the database is set up as a primary or replica instance. In the
   case of *set*, it means the container is started within a StatefulSet
   in a Kubernetes cluster.
 * PG_PRIMARY_USER - the value to use for the user ID created as
   primaryuser.  The *primaryuser* has super user privileges.
 * PG_PRIMARY_PASSWORD - the password for the PG_PRIMARY_USER database user
 * PG_USER - the value to use for the user ID created as a normal user.
   This user is created as part of the setup.sql script upon database
   creation and allows users to predefine an application user.
 * PG_PASSWORD - the password for the PG_USER database user that is created
 * PG_DATABASE - a database that is created upon database initialization
 * PG_ROOT_PASSWORD - the postgres user password set up upon database
   initialization
 * PG_LOCALE - if set, the locale you want to create the database with, if
   not set, the default locale is used
 * SYNC_REPLICA - if set, this value is used to specify the application_name
   of a replica that will be used for a synchronous replication
 * CHECKSUMS - if set, this value is used to enable the *--data-checksums*
   option when initdb is executed at initialization, if not set, the
   default is to *not* enable data checksums
 * XLOGDIR - if set, initdb will use the specified directory for WAL
 * ARCHIVE_MODE - if set to *on*, will enable continuous WAL archiving
   by setting the value within the postgresql.conf file *archive_mode*
   setting, if not set, the default is *off*
 * ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT - if set to a number (in seconds) , will specify
   the postgresql.conf *archive_timeout* setting, if not set, the
   default value of *60* is used.
 * PGAUDIT_ANALYZE - if set, will cause the container to also start the
   pgaudit_analyze program in the background
 * PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE - if set, will cause the container to use a /pgdata path
   name of your choosing rather than the hostname of the container which
   is the default. This is useful for a primary in a deployment.

*Features*

The following features are supported by the crunchy-postgres container:

 * use of OpenShift secrets
 * ability to restore from a database backup
 * use of custom pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf files
 * ability to override postgresql.conf configuration parameters
 * ability to override the default setup.sql script
 * ability to set the database locale
 * ability to specify a synchronous replica application_name
 * ability to specify a recovery using PITR and WAL files, see
   pitr.adoc for a detailed design explanation of how PITR
   is implemented within the container suite

*Locale Support*

Adding locale support to the container is accomplished by
running 'yum reinstall glibc_common' within the container, this
increases the size of the container image and can be removed if you
do not require specific locale support.

You can specify the PG_LOCALE env var which is passed to the initdb
command when the initial data files are created, for example:
....
"name": "PG_LOCALE",
"value": "fr_BE.UTF-8"
....

By default, no locale is specified when the initdb command is executed.


=== crunchy-backup

The crunchy-backup container executes a pg_basebackup against another
database container.  The backup is a full backup using the standard
utility included with postgres, pg_basebackup.

*Backup Location*

Backups are stored in a mounted backup volume location, using the
database host name plus *-backups*  as a sub-directory, then followed by a unique
backup directory based upon a date/timestamp.  It is left to the
user to perform database backup archives in this current version
of the container.  This backup location is referenced when performing
a database restore.

*Dependencies*

The container is meant to be using a NFS or similar network file system
to persist database backups.

*Environment Variables*

 * BACKUP_LABEL - when set, will set the label of the backup, if not
   set the default label used is *crunchy-backup*
 * BACKUP_HOST - required, this is the database we will be doing the
   backup for
 * BACKUP_USER - required, this is the database user we will be doing the
   backup with
 * BACKUP_PASS - required, this is the database password we will be doing the
   backup with
 * BACKUP_PORT - required, this is the database port we will be doing the
   backup with

=== crunchy-pgadmin4

The crunchy-ppgadmin4 container executes the pgadmin4 web application.

The pgadmin4 project is found at the following location:
https://www.pgadmin.org/

pgadmin4 provides a web user interface to PostgreSQL databases.  A
sample screenshot is below:

image:pgadmin4-screenshot.png["pgadmin screenshot",align="center",scaledwidth="80%"]


*Environment Variables*

* None

*Features*

The following features are supported by the crunchy-pgadmin4 container:

* mount config_local.py and pgadmin4.db to /data volume inside the
container to support customization and store the pgadmin4 database
file
* expose port 5050 which is the web server port
* a sample pgadmin4 database is provided with an initial administrator
user *admin@admin.org* and password of *password*

*Restrictions*

* None
