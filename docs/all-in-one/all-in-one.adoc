== All-In-One Crunchy OSE Image

To allow users to take a look at crunchy on OpenShift,
we have created an all-in-one Virtual Machine that you
can run which will include OpenShift and the Crunchy
containers.

The image can be imported as an appliance in VirtualBox.

=== configuration


The image uses a NAT interface and Host Only Interface for networking.
The Host Only interface lets us set a static IP of 192.168.56.6, this
address is related to the host's vboxnet0 ip address which by default
is 192.168.56.1 on VirtualBox.

The NAT interface allows the VM access to the internet and allows
for ssh access from the host.

The VM has an entry in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf that prepends
the 192.168.56.6 address as a nameserver.  This allows us to
do DNS discovery using the OpenShift DNS container which
binds to 192.168.56.6:53.

The image includes a Gnome UI environment if you want to use that,
especially useful for using the OpenShift web console.

The VM instance has a *crunchy* user created with a password of *crunchy*.
This user has sudo privileges.

=== OpenShift 3.3

OpenShift 3.3 is installed and running when you start the VM.

There are 10 small PVs already created and each is hosted on
a local NFS /nfsfileshare.

OpenShift is configured to allow any user to log in.  The *crunchy*
user is already created, a password of *crunchy* is also specified.  An
OpenShift project named *crunchy* is already created as well.

The *crunchy* OpenShift user has been granted OpenShift cluster-admin
privileges which allows it to do pretty much anything including
creating PVs.

You can start Gnome by logging in and typing:
....
startx
....

Firefox is installed and the OpenShift console is available at https://10.0.2.15:8443/console

=== Crunchy Images

The crunchy version 1.4.0 container images are preinstalled
in the VM instance.

=== Crunchy Examples

The crunchy container examples for OpenShift are installed
here:

==== $CCPROOT/examples/openshift
This directory contains all sorts of examples that create pods
and services when you run the run.sh script in each subdirectory.

==== $CCPROOT/examples/dedicated
This directory contains OpenShift templates that are pre-installed
into the OpenShift environment, with these you can click on Add To Project
in the web console to deploy containers.
