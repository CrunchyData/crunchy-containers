== Metrics Collection

70 different PostgreSQL metrics are collected by the crunchy-collect container, which executes both the postgres_exporter and node_exporter. Written in Go, these are both metrics exporters that work with Prometheus to provide PostgreSQL server metrics in addition to hardware and OS metrics. The crunchy-collect container gathers different metrics from the crunchy-postgres PostgreSQL database container and pushes these to the Prometheus Promgateway.

The collector is similar to the Prometheus Pushgateway, in that it allows exporting of statistics from batch jobs. It can also be used to export static metrics, such as what role a machine has. These SQL metrics are pushed to the crunchy-promgateway container, which holds the Prometheus Promgateway. This container is then scraped by crunchy-prometheus which hosts Prometheus. Grafana runs from crunchy-grafana, which displays the collected PostgreSQL metrics from the crunchy-prometheus container as a data source and uses the metrics to build dashboards. The Grafana template used is defined by default using a JSON template and is indexed by Grafana as an accessible dashboard.

Prometheus is a multi-dimensional time series data model with an elastic query language. It is used in collaboration with Grafana in this metrics suite. Overall, itâ€™s reliable, manageable, and operationally simple for efficiently storing and analyzing data for large-scale environments. It targets the Promgateway as an endpoint for scraping metrics.

Grafana is open source, adaptable and efficient data conceptualization software. This technology is capable of converting raw data to beautifully represented graphs, allowing you to easily monitor your database with a glance. In addition, it has a strong query and transformation language that allows for instantaneous and complex combinations of metrics, queries, correlations, and mathematical graphing.

To start collection of metrics on a PostgreSQL database, you add the crunchy-collect container into the pod that holds the crunchy-postgres container.

=== Overview

Metrics are stored in the crunchy-prometheus container, which runs the Prometheus time series database. It scrapes the crunchy-collect container which hosts the postgres_exporter and node_exporter for PostgreSQL server metrics as well as host and OS level metrics. These metrics are then pushed to crunchy-grafana in order to visualize the results.

The crunchy-prometheus data in this example is stored in emptyDir volume types. To persist the
data and Grafana templates long term, you will want to use NFS volume types as specified in
the script examples/openshift/metrics/run-pvc.sh.

When running crunchy-metrics, the following ports are available:

 * http://crunchy-metrics:9090 - the Prometheus web user interface
 * http://crunchy-metrics:9091 - the Prometheus pushgateway REST API
 * http://crunchy-metrics:3000 - the Grafana web user interface

=== Environment Variables

 * PROM_GATEWAY - The HTTP URL of the Prometheus Pushgateway into which the metrics will be pushed
 * NODE_EXPORTER_URL - The HTTP URL of the node_exporter utility which collects host and OS level system metrics.
 * POSTGRES_EXPORTER_URL - The HTTP URL of the postgres_exporter utility which collects PostgreSQL server metrics.
 * DATA_SOURCE_NAME - The URL for the PostgreSQL server's data source name. This is *required* to be in the form of *postgresql://*.

=== Docker

You can collect various PostgreSQL metrics from your database container by running a
crunchy-collect container that points to your database container.

To start this set of containers, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/metrics
./run.sh
....

This will start up 3 containers and services:

 * http://crunchy-metrics:9090 - the Prometheus web user interface
 * http://crunchy-metrics:9091 - the Prometheus pushgateway REST API
 * http://crunchy-metrics:3000 - the Grafana web user interface

An example has been provided that runs a database container
and also the associated metrics collection container, run the
example as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/collect
./run.sh
....

Every 3 minutes the collection container will collect PostgreSQL
metrics and push them to the Crunchy Prometheus database.  You
can graph them using the Crunchy Grafana container.

If firewalld is enabled in your environment, it may be necessary
to allow the necessary ports through the firewall. This can be
accomplished by the following:

....
firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone metrics
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9090/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9091/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 3000/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
....

=== Kubernetes

This example starts up Prometheus and Grafana.

It is required to view or capture metrics collected by crunchy-collect.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/metrics
./run.sh
....

This will start up 3 containers and services:

 * http://crunchy-metrics:9090 - the Prometheus web user interface
 * http://crunchy-metrics:9091 - the Prometheus pushgateway REST API
 * http://crunchy-metrics:3000 - the Grafana web user interface

If you want your metrics and dashboards to persist to NFS, run
this script:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/metrics
./run-pvc.sh
....

In the docs folder of the github repo, check out the metrics.adoc
for details on the exact metrics being collected.

This example runs a pod that includes a database container and
a metrics collection container. A service is also created for the pod.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/collect
./run.sh
....

If firewalld is enabled in your environment, it may be necessary
to allow the necessary ports through the firewall. This can be
accomplished by the following:

....
firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone metrics
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9090/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9091/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 3000/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
....

You can view the collect container logs using this command:
....
kubectl logs -c collect primary-collect
....

You can access the database or drive load against it using
this command:
....
psql -h primary-collect -U postgres postgres
....

=== OpenShift

This example starts up Prometheus and Grafana.

It is required to view or capture metrics collected by crunchy-collect.

First, create the crunchy-metrics pod which contains
the Prometheus data store and the Grafana graphing web application:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/metrics
./run.sh
....

This will start up 3 containers and services:

 * http://crunchy-metrics:9090 - the Prometheus web user interface
 * http://crunchy-metrics:9091 - the Prometheus pushgateway REST API
 * http://crunchy-metrics:3000 - the Grafana web user interface

When accessing the Grafana web application, the default user credentials will be
the username **admin** and the password **admin**.

Next, start a PostgreSQL pod that has the crunchy-collect container
as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/collect
./run.sh
....

At this point, metrics will be collected every 3 minutes and pushed
to Prometheus.  You can build graphs off the metrics using Grafana.

If firewalld is enabled in your environment, it may be necessary
to allow the necessary ports through the firewall. This can be
accomplished by the following:

....
firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone metrics
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9090/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9091/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 3000/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
....

=== Grafana Dashboard

Some information on creating custom Grafana dashboards can be found in the official documentation -
http://docs.grafana.org/guides/getting_started/.

Crunchy Data offers some customized metrics dashboards that can be imported into Grafana. This project
is called *pgmonitor* and can be found in the link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgmonitor[pgmonitor repository].
The official instructions for setting up the project can be found link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgmonitor/tree/master/grafana[here],
but a visual walkthrough and screenshots of the populated graphs are provided below.

The following instructions assume you already have the *crunchy-metrics* and *primary-collect* examples running
for your chosen environment.

First, clone the *pgmonitor* repository.
....
git clone https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgmonitor/tree/master/grafana
....

You can then connect to the Grafana web instance using the following address:
....
http://crunchy-metrics:3000
....

The username and password are both *admin* by default. It is a recommended security measure to change these values.

After logging in, you'll be taken to a "Home Dashboard" page. Click "add data source", where you'll be taken to
a page to populate your data source. In this instance, you'll want to select "type" as being "Prometheus" and change
the URL to point to "http://crunchy-metrics:9090" (or directly to the IP address with port 9090 where your Promtheus
datasource resides). The screen should appear like this after you've finished:


image::images/grafana_s2.png[]


Next, the dashboards themeselves need to be imported as JSON files. Navigate to the upper left corner and select the
Grafana logo for the menu, then to Dashboards -> Import. Select "Upload JSON File" and repeat the process for each
of these JSON files:

  * PostgreSQL.json
  * PostgreSQLDetails.json
  * BloatDetails.json
  * CRUD_Details.json

The "Import Datasource" box should look similar to this before clicking "Import":
