For OpenShift, use the value of oc as the CCP_CLI variable instead.\n   It will be necessary to refresh your .bashrc file in order for the changes to take effect.\n . ~/.bashrc   Next, set up a project directory structure and pull down the project:\n mkdir -p $HOME/cdev/src $HOME/cdev/pkg $HOME/cdev/bin     Installing Requirements CentOS 7 cd $GOPATH sudo yum -y install golang git docker go get github.com/tools/godep cd src/github.com mkdir crunchydata cd crunchydata git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers cd crunchy-containers git checkout 2.0 go get github.com/blang/expenv   If you are a Crunchy enterprise customer, you will place the Crunchy repository key and yum repository file into the $CCPROOT/conf directory at this point. These files can be obtained through https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads page.\n    RHEL 7 When setting up the environment on RHEL 7, there are slightly different steps that need to be taken.\n cd $GOPATH sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms sudo yum -y install git golang go get github.com/tools/godep cd src/github.com mkdir crunchydata cd crunchydata git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers cd crunchy-containers git checkout 2.0 go get github.com/blang/expenv   If you are a Crunchy enterprise customer, you will place the Crunchy repository key and yum repository file into the $CCPROOT/conf directory at this point. These files can be obtained through https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads page.\n    PostgreSQL These installation instructions assume the installation of PostgreSQL 10 through the official PGDG repository. View the documentation located here in order to view more detailed notes or install a different version of PostgreSQL.\n Locate and edit your distribution\u0026#8217;s .repo file, located:\n   On CentOS: /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo, [base] and [updates] sections\n  On Red Hat: /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf [main] section\n   To the section(s) identified above, you need to append a line (otherwise dependencies might resolve to the PostgreSQL supplied by the base repository):\n exclude=postgresql*   Next, install the RPM relating to the base operating system and PostgreSQL version you wish to install. The RPMs can be found here.\n For example, to install PostgreSQL 10 on a CentOS 7 system:\n sudo yum -y install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/10/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos10-10-2.noarch.rpm   Or to install PostgreSQL 10 on a RHEL 7 system:\n sudo yum -y install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/testing/10/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat10-10-2.noarch.rpm   You\u0026#8217;ll need to update your system:\n sudo yum -y update   Then, go ahead and install the PostgreSQL server package.\n sudo yum -y install postgresql10-server.x86_64    Docker As good practice, at this point you\u0026#8217;ll update your system.\n sudo yum -y update   Now we\u0026#8217;ll install Docker.\n sudo yum -y install docker   After that, it\u0026#8217;s necessary to add the docker group and give your user access to that group (here referenced as someuser):\n sudo groupadd docker sudo usermod -a -G docker someuser   Remember to log out of the someuser account for the Docker group to be added to your current session. Once it\u0026#8217;s added, you\u0026#8217;ll be able to run Docker commands from your user account.\n su - someuser   You can ensure your someuser account is added correctly by running the following command and ensuring docker appears as one of the results:\n groups   Before you start Docker, you might consider configuring Docker storage: This is described if you run:\n man docker-storage-setup   Follow the instructions available on the main OpenShift documentation page to configure Docker storage appropriately.\n These steps are illustrative of a typical process for setting up Docker storage. You will need to run these commands as root.\n First, add an extra virtual hard disk to your virtual machine (see this blog post for tips on how to do so).\n Run this command to format the drive, where /dev/sd? is the new hard drive that was added:\n fdisk /dev/sd?   Next, create a volume group on the new drive partition within the fdisk utility:\n vgcreate docker-vg /dev/sd?   Then, you\u0026#8217;ll need to edit the docker-storage-setup configuration file in order to override default options. Add these two lines to /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup:\n DEVS=/dev/sd? VG=docker-vg   Finally, run the command docker-storage-setup to use that new volume group. The results should state that the physical volume /dev/sd? and the volume group docker-vg have both been successfully created.\n Next, we enable and start up Docker:\n sudo systemctl enable docker.service sudo systemctl start docker.service   Verify that Docker version 1.12.6 was installed, as per the OpenShift 3.6 requirements.\n docker version    OpenShift See the OpenShift installation guide for details on how to install OpenShift Enterprise on your host. The main instructions are here:\n https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/install/quick_install.html\n   Note  If you install OpenShift Enterprise on a server with less than 16GB memory and 40GB of disk, the following Ansible variables need to be added to ~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml prior to installation:     openshift_check_min_host_disk_gb: '10' # min 10gb disk openshift_check_min_host_memory_gb: '3' # min 3gb memory    Kubernetes See kubeadm for installing the latest version of Kubernetes.\n Please see here to view the official documentation regarding configuring DNS for your Kubernetes cluster.\n Make sure your hostname resolves to a single IP address in your /etc/hosts file. The NFS examples will not work otherwise and other problems with installation can occur unless you have a resolving hostname.\n You should see a single IP address returned from this command:\n hostname --ip-address   When running the containers in GKE Role Based Account Control will need to be set up.\n kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \\ --clusterrole cluster-admin --user $(gcloud config get-value account)   If more than one user will be running on the same kubernetes cluster in GKE, from the above command cluster-admin-binding will need to be unique and is the name that is added to the clusterrolebidings. The example below will add another user to the clusterrolebinding with a unique value.\n $ ACCOUNT=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.account)') $ kubectl create clusterrolebinding \u0026lt;unique\u0026gt;-cluster-admin-binding \\ --clusterrole cluster-admin \\ --user $ACCOUNT ACCOUNT is just your google gcloud acount login, ie username@google.com    Helm Some Kubernetes Helm examples are provided in the following directory as one option for deploying the Container Suite.\n $CCPROOT/examples/helm/   Once you have your Kubernetes environment configured, it is simple to get Helm up and running. Please refer to this document to get Helm installed and configured properly.\n    Creating a Demo Namespace In Kubernetes, a concept called a namespace provides the means to separate created resources or components into individual logically grouped partitions.\n It is considered a best practice to have dedicated namespaces for projects in both testing and production environments.\n   Note  All examples in the Crunchy Container Suite operate within the namespace defined by the environment variable $CCP_NAMESPACE. The instructions below illustrate how to set up and work within new namespaces or projects in both Kubernetes and OpenShift.     Kubernetes This section will illustrate how to set up a new Kubernetes namespace called demo, and will then show how to provide permissions to that namespace to allow the Kubernetes examples to run within that namespace.\n First, view currently existing namespaces:\n $ kubectl get namespace NAME STATUS AGE default Active 21d kube-public Active 21d kube-system Active 21d   Then, create a new namespace called demo:\n $ kubectl create -f $CCPROOT/conf/demo-namespace.json namespace \"demo\" created $ kubectl get namespace demo NAME STATUS AGE demo Active 7s   Then set the namespace as the current location to avoid using the wrong namespace:\n $ kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=demo   We can verify that the namespace was set correctly through the following command:\n $ kubectl config view | grep namespace: namespace: demo    OpenShift This section assumes you are first logging into OpenShift as a normal user such as:\n oc login -u someuser   For our development purposes only, we typically specify the OCP Authorization policy of AllowAll as documented here:\n https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/install_config/configuring_authentication.html#AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider\n We do not recommend this authentication policy for a production deployment of OCP.\n The next step is to create a demo namespace to run the examples within. The name of this OCP project will be what you supply in the CCP_NAMESPACE environment variable:\n $ oc new-project demo --description=\"Crunchy Containers project\" --display-name=\"Crunchy-Containers\" Now using project \"demo\" on server \"https://127.0.0.1:8443\". $ export CCP_NAMESPACE=demo   If we view the list of projects, we can see the new project has been added and is \"active\".\n $ oc get projects NAME DISPLAY NAME STATUS demo Crunchy-Containers Active myproject My Project Active   If you were on a different project and wanted to switch to the demo project, you would do so by running the following:\n $ oc project demo Now using project \"demo\" on server \"https://127.0.0.1:8443\".   Finally, you will want to ensure the proper privileges are added to the user in order to have the ability to create persistent volumes. A command similar to the following can be used to accomplish this, by adding the cluster-admin role to the demo user:\n oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin demo      Next Steps Next, build or pull the container images as demonstrated in the Build the Containers document.\n   "

The Crunchy release is meant for customers that require enterprise level support.\n The PGDG community RPMs can be used as well by simply commenting out the Crunchy yum repo within the Dockerfiles and uncommenting the PGDG yum repo.\n  setup.sql The setup.sql script is used to define startup SQL commands that are executed when the database is first created.\n  Environment Variables   PG_MODE - either primary, replica or set, this value determines whether the database is set up as a primary or replica instance. In the case of set, it means the container is started within a StatefulSet in a Kubernetes cluster.\n  PG_PRIMARY_USER - the value to use for the user ID created as primaryuser. The primaryuser has super user privileges.\n  PG_PRIMARY_PASSWORD - the password for the PG_PRIMARY_USER database user\n  PG_USER - the value to use for the user ID created as a normal user. This user is created as part of the setup.sql script upon database creation and allows users to predefine an application user.\n  PG_PASSWORD - the password for the PG_USER database user that is created\n  PG_DATABASE - a database that is created upon database initialization\n  PG_ROOT_PASSWORD - the PostgreSQL user password set up upon database initialization\n  PG_LOCALE - if set, the locale you want to create the database with, if not set, the default locale is used\n  SYNC_REPLICA - if set, this value is used to specify the application_name of a replica that will be used for a synchronous replication\n  CHECKSUMS - if set, this value is used to enable the --data-checksums option when initdb is executed at initialization, if not set, the default is to not enable data checksums\n  ARCHIVE_MODE - if set to on, will enable continuous WAL archiving by setting the value within the postgresql.conf file archive_mode setting, if not set, the default is off\n  ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT - if set to a number (in seconds) , will specify the postgresql.conf archive_timeout setting, if not set, the default value of 60 is used.\n  PGAUDIT_ANALYZE - if set, will cause the container to also start the pgaudit_analyze program in the background\n  PG_PRIMARY_HOST - for when PG_MODE is set, specifies the primary host for setting the primary label\n  PG_REPLICA_HOST - for when PG_MODE is set, specifies the replica host for setting the replica label\n  PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE - if set, will cause the container to use a /pgdata path name of your choosing rather than the hostname of the container which is the default. This is useful for a primary in a deployment.\n  XLOGDIR - if set to true, will cause initdb to include --xlogdir=$PGWAL, this will cause a symlink to be created from /pgdata/containername/pg_wal (or pg_xlog if you\u0026#8217;re running PG 9.5 or 9.6) to /pgwal/containername-wal\n  TEMP_BUFFERS - default is 8MB, set this value to override this PostgreSQL configuration setting\n  MAX_CONNECTIONS - default is 100, set this value to override this PostgreSQL configuration setting\n  SHARED_BUFFERS - default is 128MB, set this value to override this PostgreSQL configuration setting\n  WORK_MEM - default is 4MB, set this value to override this PostgreSQL configuration setting\n  MAX_WAL_SENDERS - default is 6, set this value to override this PostgreSQL configuration setting\n  ENABLE_SSHD- default is false, set this value to true to enable SSHD\n  CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs.

These metrics are scrapped and stored by Crunchy Prometheus time-series database and visualized by Crunchy Grafana.\n  Requirements This container requires TCP access to the PostgreSQL database to run queries for collecting metrics. The PostgreSQL database to be scrapped is specified by the DATA_SOURCE_NAME environment variable.\n Additionally, custom queries to collect metrics can be specified by the user. By mounting a queries.yml file to /conf on the container, additionally metrics can be specified for the API to collect. For an example of a queries.yml file, see here.\n  Environment Variables Required:\n   DATA_SOURCE_NAME - The URL for the PostgreSQL server\u0026#8217;s data source name. This is required to be in the form of postgresql://.\n   Optional: * CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs. Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.\n    crunchy-prometheus Description Prometheus is a multi-dimensional time series data model with an elastic query language. It is used in collaboration with Grafana in this metrics suite. Overall, it’s reliable, manageable, and operationally simple for efficiently storing and analyzing data for large-scale environments. It scraps metrics from exporters such as Crunchy Collect.\n The following port is exposed by the crunchy-prometheus container:\n   crunchy-prometheus:9090 - the Prometheus web user interface\n    Requirements The Crunchy Prometheus container must be able to reach the Crunchy Collect container to scrape metrics.\n By default, Crunchy Prometheus detects which environment its running on (Docker, Kube or OCP) and applies a default configuration. If this container is running on Kube or OCP, it will use the Kubernetes API to discover pods with the label \"crunchy-collect\": \"true\". Crunchy Collect container must have this label to be discovered.\n For Docker environments the Crunchy Collect hostname must be specified as an environment variable.\n A user may define a custom prometheus.yml file and mount to /conf for custom configuration. For a configuration examples, see here.\n  Environment Variables Required:\n   COLLECT_HOST - Hostname of Crunchy Collect container. Only required in Docker environments.\n   Optional:\n   SCRAPE_INTERVAL - default is \"5s\", set this value to the number of seconds to scrape metrics from exporters.\n  SCRAPE_TIMEOUT - default is \"5s\", set this value to the number of seconds to timeout when scraping metrics from exporters.\n  CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs. Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.\n      crunchy-grafana Description Visual dashboards are created from the collected and stored data that crunchy-collect and crunchy-prometheus provides with the crunchy-grafana container, which hosts a web-based graphing dashboard called Grafana.\n Grafana is an open-source platform which can then apply the defined metrics and visualize information through various tools. It is extremely flexible with a powerful query and transformation language, producing beautiful and easily understandable graphics to analyze and monitor your data.\n By default, Crunchy Grafana will register the Crunchy Prometheus datasource within Grafana and import a premade dashboard for PostgreSQL monitoring.\n The following port is exposed by the crunchy-grafana container:\n   crunchy-grafana:3000 - the Grafana web user interface\n    Requirements The Crunchy Grafana container must be able to reach the Crunchy Prometheus container.\n Users must specify an administrator user and password to provide basic authentication for the web frontend.\n Additionally the Prometheus Host and Port are required. If Prometheus uses basic authentication, users must specify the username and password to access Prometheus via environment variables.\n Users may define a custom defaults.ini file and mount to /conf for custom configuration. For a configuration examples, see here.\n  Environment Variables Required:\n   ADMIN_USER - specifies the administrator user to be used when logging into the web frontend.\n  ADMIN_PASS - specifies the administrator password to be used when logging into the web frontend.\n  PROM_HOST - specifies the Prometheus container hostname for auto registering the prometheus datasource.\n  PROM_PORT - specifies the Prometheus container port for auto registering the prometheus datasource.\n   Optional:\n   PROM_USER - specifies the Prometheus username, if one is required.\n  PROM_PASS - specifies the Prometheus password, if one is required.\n  CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs. Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.\n      crunchy-pgbadger The crunchy-pgbadger container executes the pgbadger utility. A small http server is running on the container, when a request is made to:\n http://\u0026lt;\u0026lt;ip address\u0026gt;\u0026gt;:10000/api/badgergenerate   Environment Variables Optional:\n   BADGER_TARGET - only used in standalone mode to specify the name of the container, also used to find the location of the database log files in /pgdata/$BADGER_TARGET/pg_log/*.log\n  BADGER_CUSTOM_OPTS - no default, set this value to provide custom flags to pgbadger. For a list of optional flags, see the official pgBadger documentation.\n  CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs. Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.\n    Features The following features are supported by the crunchy-pgbadger container:\n   Generate a full report by default\n  Optional custom options for more advanced use cases (such as incremental reports)\n  Report persistence on a volume\n      crunchy-pgpool The crunchy-pgpool container executes the pgpool utility. Pgpool can be used to provide a smart PostgreSQL-aware proxy to a PostgreSQL cluster, both primary and replica, so that applications can only have to work with a single database connection.\n Postgres replicas are read-only whereas a primary is both read and write capable.\n The default pgpool examples use a Secret to hold the set of pgpool configuration files used by the examples. The Secret is mounted into the pgconf volume mount where the container will look to find configuration files. If you do not specify your own configuration files via a Secret then you can specify environment variables to the container that it will attempt to use to configure pgpool, this is not recommended however for a real pgpool deployment.\n Environment Variables   PG_USERNAME - user to connect to PostgreSQL\n  PG_PASSWORD - user password to connect to PostgreSQL\n  PG_PRIMARY_SERVICE_NAME - database host to connect to for the primary node\n  PG_REPLICA_SERVICE_NAME - database host to connect to for the replica node\n  CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs. Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.\n    Features The following features are supported by the crunchy-pgpool container:\n   basic invocation of pgpool\n      crunchy-watch crunchy-watch runs as a pod unto itself typically. The watch container essentially does a health check on a primary database container and performs a failover sequence if the primary is not reached.\n The watch container has access to a service account that is used inside the container to issue commands to OpenShift.\n In Kube 1.5, if a policy file is being used for securing down the Kube cluster, you could possibly need to add a policy to allow the pg-watcher service account access to the Kube API as mentioned here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/abac/#a-quick-note-on-service-accounts\n In Kube 1.6, an equivalent RBAC policy is also possibly required depending on your authorization/authentication configuration. See this link for details on the new RBAC policy mechanism: https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/\n For example, you can grant cluster-admin permissions on the pg-watcher service account, in the my-namespace namespace as follows:\n kubectl create clusterrolebinding pgwatcher-view-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=my-namespace:pg-watcher   A less wide open policy would be applied like this on Kube 1.6 rbac:\n kubectl create rolebinding my-sa-binding --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=demo:pg-watcher --namespace=demo     Note  this kubectl command is only available in Kube 1.6, for prior Kube release such as 1.5 and the alpha RBAC, you will need to specify the role binding in a JSON/YAML file instead of using this command syntax above.     You then reference the SA within the POD spec.\n The oc/docker/kubectl commands are included into the container from the host when the container image is built. These commands are used by the watch logic to interact with the replica containers.\n Starting with release 1.7.1 crunchy-watch source code is relocated to https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-watch\n Environment Variables   CRUNCHY_WATCH_HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL - the time to sleep in seconds between checking on the primary\n  CRUNCHY_WATCH_FAILOVER_WAIT - the time to sleep in seconds between triggering the failover and updating its label (default is 40 secs)\n  PG_CONTAINER_NAME - if set, the name of the container to refer to when doing an exec, this is required if you have more than 1 container in your database pod\n  CRUNCHY_WATCH_PRIMARY - the primary service name\n  CRUNCHY_WATCH_REPLICA - the replica service name\n  PG_PRIMARY_PORT - database port to use when checking the database\n  CRUNCHY_WATCH_USERNAME - database user account to use when checking the database using pg_isready utility\n  CRUNCHY_WATCH_DATABASE - database to use when checking the database using pg_isready\n  REPLICA_TO_TRIGGER_LABEL - the pod name of a replica that you want to choose as the new primary in a failover; this will override the normal replica selection\n  CRUNCHY_WATCH_PRE_HOOK - path to an executable file to run before failover is processed.\n  CRUNCHY_WATCH_POST_HOOK - path to an executable file to run after failover is processed.\n  CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs. Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.\n    Logic The watch container will watch the primary, if the primary dies, then the watcher will:\n   create the trigger file on the replica that will become the new primary\n  change the labels on the replica to be those of the primary\n  start watching the new primary in case that falls over next\n  look for replicas that have the metadata label value of replicatype=trigger to prefer the failover to. If found, it will use the first replica with that label; if not found, it will use the first replica it finds.\n   Example of looking for the failover replica:\n oc get pod -l name=pg-replica-rc-dc NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pg-replica-rc-dc 1/1 Running 2 16m pg-replica-rc-dc-1-96qs8 1/1 Running 1 16m oc get pod -l replicatype=trigger NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pg-replica-rc-dc 1/1 Running 2 16m      crunchy-vacuum Description The crunchy-vacuum container allows you to perform a SQL VACUUM job against a PostgreSQL database container. You specify a database to vacuum using various environment variables which are listed below. It is possible to run different vacuum operations either manually or automatically through scheduling.\n The crunchy-vacuum image is executed, passed in the Postgres connection parameters to the single-primary PostgreSQL container. The type of vacuum performed is dictated by the environment variables passed into the job.\n  Environment Variables The complete set of environment variables read by the crunchy-vacuum job include:\n   VAC_FULL - when set to true adds the FULL parameter to the VACUUM command\n  VAC_TABLE - when set, allows you to specify a single table to vacuum, when not specified, the entire database tables are vacuumed\n  JOB_HOST - required variable is the postgres host we connect to\n  PG_USER - required variable is the postgres user we connect with\n  PG_DATABASE - required variable is the postgres database we connect to\n  PG_PASSWORD - required variable is the postgres user password we connect with\n  PG_PORT - allows you to override the default value of 5432\n  VAC_ANALYZE - when set to true adds the ANALYZE parameter to the VACUUM command\n  VAC_VERBOSE - when set to true adds the VERBOSE parameter to the VACUUM command\n  VAC_FREEZE - when set to true adds the FREEZE parameter to the VACUUM command\n  CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs. Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.\n      crunchy-dba The crunchy-dba container implements a cron scheduler. The purpose of the crunchy-dba container is to offer a way to perform simple DBA tasks that occur on some form of schedule such as backup jobs or running a vacuum on a single Postgres database container.\n You can either run the crunchy-dba container as a single pod or include the container within a database pod.\n The crunchy-dba container makes use of a Service Account to perform the startup of scheduled jobs. The Kube Job type is used to execute the scheduled jobs with a Restart policy of Never.\n Environment Variables The following environment variables control the actions of crunchy-dba:\n   OSE_PROJECT - required, the OSE project name to log into\n  JOB_HOST - required, the PostgreSQL container name the action will be taken against\n  VAC_SCHEDULE - if set, this will start a vacuum job container. The setting value must be a valid cron expression as described below.\n  BACKUP_SCHEDULE - if set, this will start a backup job container. The setting value must be a valid cron expression as described below.\n  CRUNCHY_DEBUG - default is false, set this value to true to debugging in logs. Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.\n   For a vacuum job, you are required to supply the following environment variables:\n   JOB_HOST\n  PG_USER\n  PG_PASSWORD\n  PG_DATABASE - defaults to postgres when not specified\n  PG_PORT - defaults to 5432 when not specified\n  VAC_ANALYZE(optional) - defaults to true when not specified\n  VAC_FULL(optional) - defaults to true when not specified\n  VAC_VERBOSE(optional) - defaults to true when not specified\n  VAC_FREEZE(optional) - defaults to false when not specified\n  VAC_TABLE(optional) - defaults to all tables when not specified, or you can set this value to indicate a single table to vacuum\n   For a backup job, you are required to supply the following environment variables:\n   JOB_HOST\n  PG_USER - database user used to perform the backup\n  PG_PASSWORD - database user password used to perform the backup\n  PG_PORT - port value used when connecting for a backup to the database\n  BACKUP_PV_CAPACITY - a value like 1Gi is used to define the PV storage capacity\n  BACKUP_PV_PATH - the storage path used to build the PV\n  BACKUP_PV_HOST - the storage host used to build the PV\n  BACKUP_PVC_STORAGE - a value like 75M means to allow 75 megabytes for the PVC used in performing the backup\n    CRON Expression Format A cron expression represents a set of times, using 6 space-separated fields.\n Table 1. Table Fields     Field name Mandatory? Allowed values Allowed special characters     Seconds\n Yes\n 0-59\n * / , -\n   Minutes\n Yes\n 0-59\n * / , -\n   Hours\n Yes\n 0-23\n * / , -\n   Day of month\n Yes\n 1-31\n * / , - ?\n   Month\n Yes\n 1-12 or JAN-DEC\n * / , -\n   Day of week\n Yes\n 0-6 or SUN-SAT\n * / , - ?\n      Note  Month and Day-of-week field values are case insensitive. SUN'', Sun'', and ``sun'' are equally accepted.     Special Characters Asterisk ( * ) The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month.\n  Slash ( / ) Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form *\\/\u0026#8230;\u0026#8203;'' is equivalent to the form first-last/\u0026#8230;\u0026#8203;'', that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field. The form N/\u0026#8230;\u0026#8203;'' is accepted as meaning N-MAX/\u0026#8230;\u0026#8203;'', that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does not wrap around.\n  Comma ( , ) Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using ``MON,WED,FRI'' in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\n  Hyphen ( - ) Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive.\n  Question mark ( ? ) Question mark may be used instead of '*' for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank.\n   Predefined schedules You may use one of several pre-defined schedules in place of a cron expression.\n Table 2. Table Predefined Schedules     Entry Description Equivalent To     @yearly (or @annually)\n Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st\n 0 0 0 1 1 *\n   @monthly\n Run once a month, midnight, first of month\n 0 0 0 1 * *\n   @weekly\n Run once a week, midnight on Sunday\n 0 0 0 * * 0\n   @daily (or @midnight)\n Run once a day, midnight\n 0 0 0 * * *\n   @hourly\n Run once an hour, beginning of hour\n 0 0 * * * *\n     Intervals You may also schedule a job to execute at fixed intervals. This is supported by formatting the cron spec like this:\n @every \u0026lt;duration\u0026gt;   where ``duration'' is a string accepted by time.ParseDuration (http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).\n For example, ``@every 1h30m10s'' would indicate a schedule that activates every 1 hour, 30 minutes, 10 seconds.\n   Note  The interval does not take the job runtime into account. For example, if a job takes 3 minutes to run, and it is scheduled to run every 5 minutes, it will have only 2 minutes of idle time between each run.      Time zones All interpretation and scheduling is done in the machines local time zone (as provided by the Go time package (http://www.golang.org/pkg/time). Be aware that jobs scheduled during daylight-savings leap-ahead transitions will not be run!\n     crunchy-pgbouncer Crunchy pgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL databases.\n Environment Variables REQUIRED ARGS   PGBOUNCER_PASSWORD - the password of the pgbouncer role in PostgreSQL.

	"content": "Table of Contents Available Storage Types HostPath NFS Dynamic Storage Next Steps   v2.0, 2018-07-21\n Available Storage Types The Container Suite is tested on 3 different storage backends:\n   hostPath (single node testing)\n  NFS (single and multi-node testing)\n  Gluster (dynamic storage on separate Gluster cluster)\n   Other storage backends work as well including GCE, EBS, ScaleIO, and others, but may require you to modify various examples or configuration.\n Environment variables are set to determine how and what storage is to be used.\n   HostPath HostPath is the simplest storage backend to setup. It is only feasible on a single node but is sufficient for testing the examples. In your .bashrc file, add the following variables to specify unique settings to the HostPath directory:\n export CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT=\"\" export CCP_STORAGE_PATH=/data export CCP_STORAGE_MODE=ReadWriteMany export CCP_STORAGE_CAPACITY=400M     Note  It may be necessary to grant your user in OpenShift or Kubernetes the rights to modify the hostaccess SCC. This can be done with the command: oadm policy add-scc-to-user hostaccess $(oc whoami)       NFS NFS can also be used as a storage mechanism. Instructions on setting up NFS are found at the bottom of this guide.\n For testing with NFS, in your .bashrc file, include the following variables that are unique to your NFS environment:\n export CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT='\"supplementalGroups\": [65534]' export CCP_STORAGE_PATH=/mnt/nfsfileshare export CCP_NFS_IP=192.168.0.118 export CCP_STORAGE_MODE=ReadWriteMany export CCP_STORAGE_CAPACITY=400M   In this example above the group ownership of the NFS mount is assumed to be nfsnobody or 65534.\n   Configuration Notes for NFS   Note: Most of the Crunchy containers run as the postgres UID (26), but you will notice that when supplementalGroups is specified, the pod will include the nfsnobody group in the list of groups for the pod user.\n First, if you are running your NFS system with SELinux in enforcing mode, you will need to run the following command to allow NFS write permissions:\n sudo setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1   Detailed instructions that you can use for setting up a NFS server on Centos 7 are provided in the following link.\n http://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-setup-nfs-server-on-centos-7-rhel-7-fedora-22.html\n if you are running your client on a VM, you will need to add 'insecure' to the exportfs file on the NFS server due to the way port translation is done between the VM host and the VM instance.\n For more details on this bug, please see the following link.\n http://serverfault.com/questions/107546/mount-nfs-access-denied-by-server-while-mounting\n A suggested best practice for tuning NFS for PostgreSQL is to configure the PostgreSQL fstab mount options like so:\n proto=tcp,suid,rw,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,hard,fg,rsize=8192,wsize=8192   Network options:\n MTU=9000   If interested in mounting the same NFS share multiple times on the same mount point, look into the noac mount option.\n      Dynamic Storage Dynamic storage classes can be used for the examples. Gluster is only one example of a storage type that supports dynamic storage classes. The environment variable CCP_STORAGE_CLASS is used in the examples to determine whether or not to create a PersistentVolume manually or that it will be created dynamically using a StorageClass. In the case of GKE, the default StorageClass is named default. Storage class names are determined by the Kubernetes administrator and can vary.\n Setting up a Gluster cluster will offer you the ability to use dynamic storage provisioning in the examples. A set of example Gluster configuration files is found at $CCPROOT/docs/gluster. This configuration is for a 3 node Gluster cluster which runs on a Centos7 Minimal VM deployment.\n Using block storage requires a security context to be set as follows:\n export CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT='\"fsGroup\":26' export CCP_STORAGE_CLASS=standard export CCP_STORAGE_MODE=ReadWriteOnce export CCP_STORAGE_CAPACITY=400M     Next Steps There are many ways to configure the examples and containers further. Descriptions of each container offered and the variables that can be used to customize them are found on the Container Specifications page.\n Information can be found on the full scope of examples that can be performed on the Getting Started page.\n   "

See this link for details on the new RBAC policy mechanism.\nFor example, you can grant cluster-admin permissions on the pg-watcher service account in the my-namespace namespace as follows:\nkubectl create clusterrolebinding pgwatcher-view-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=my-namespace:pg-watcher A less wide open policy would be applied like this on Kube 1.6 rbac:\nkubectl create rolebinding my-sa-binding --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=demo:pg-watcher --namespace=demo The above kubectl command is only available in Kubernetes 1.6.

CRON Expression Format A cron expression represents a set of times, using 6 space-separated fields.\n   Field Name Mandatory? Allowed Values Allowed Special Characters     Seconds Yes 0-59 * / , -   Minutes Yes 0-59 * / , -   Hours Yes 0-23 * / , -   Day of month Yes 1-31 * / , - ?   Month Yes 1-12 or JAN-DEC * / , -   Day of week Yes 0-6 or SUN-SAT * / , - ?    Month and Day-of-week field values are case insensitive. \u0026ldquo;SUN\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Sun\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;sun\u0026rdquo; are equally accepted.\n Special Characters Asterisk The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month.\nSlash Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59\u0026frasl;15 in the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form \u0026ldquo;*\\/\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; is equivalent to the form \u0026ldquo;first-last/\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field. The form \u0026ldquo;N/\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; is accepted as meaning \u0026ldquo;N-MAX/\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does not wrap around.\nComma Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using \u0026ldquo;MON,WED,FRI\u0026rdquo; in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\nHyphen Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive.\nQuestion mark Question mark may be used instead of \u0026ldquo;*\u0026rdquo; for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank.\nPredefined schedules You may use one of several pre-defined schedules in place of a cron expression.\n   Entry Description Equivalent To     @yearly (or @annually) Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st 0 0 0 1 1 *   @monthly Run once a month, midnight, first of month 0 0 0 1 * *   @weekly Run once a week, midnight on Sunday 0 0 0 * * 0   @daily (or @midnight) Run once a day, midnight 0 0 0 * * *   @hourly Run once an hour, beginning of hour 0 0 * * * *    Intervals You may also schedule a job to execute at fixed intervals. This is supported by formatting the cron spec like this:\n@every \u0026lt;duration\u0026gt;  where \u0026ldquo;duration\u0026rdquo; is a string accepted by time.ParseDuration (http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).\nFor example, \u0026ldquo;@every 1h30m10s\u0026rdquo; would indicate a schedule that activates every 1 hour, 30 minutes, 10 seconds.\nNOTE: The interval does not take the job runtime into account. For example, if a job takes 3 minutes to run, and it is scheduled to run every 5 minutes, it will have only 2 minutes of idle time between each run.\nTime zones All interpretation and scheduling is done in the machines local time zone (as provided by the Go time package (http://www.golang.org/pkg/time).\nBe aware that jobs scheduled during daylight-savings leap-ahead transitions will not be run.\n "

Ensure the CCP_CLI environment variable is set to the correct binary for your environment.\n   Set the environment variable in .bashrc to ensure the examples will work in your environment.\n # Kubernetes export CCP_CLI=kubectl # OpenShift export CCP_CLI=oc   Here are some useful resources for finding the right commands to troubleshoot \u0026amp; modify containers in the various environments shown in this guide:\n   Docker Cheat Sheet\n  Kubectl Cheat Sheet\n  OpenShift Cheat Sheet\n  Helm Cheat Sheet\n     Example Conventions The examples provided in Container Suite are simple examples that are meant to demonstrate key Container Suite features. These examples can be used to build more production level deployments as dictated by user requirements specific to their operating environments.\n The examples generally follow these conventions:\n   There is a run.sh script that you will execute to start the example.\n  There is a cleanup.sh script that you will execute to shutdown and cleanup the example.\n  Each example will create resources such as Secrets, ConfigMaps, Services, and PersistentVolumeClaims, all which follow a naming convention of \u0026lt;example name\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;optional description suffix\u0026gt;. For example an example called primary might have a PersistentVolumeClaim called primary-pgconf to describe the purpose of that particular PVC.\n  The folder names for each example give a clue as to which Container Suite feature it demonstrates. For instance, the examples/kube/pgaudit example demonstrates how to enable the pg_audit capability of the crunchy-postgres container.\n     Administration Password Management The passwords used for the PostgreSQL user accounts are generated by the OpenShift process command. To inspect what value is supplied, you can inspect the primary pod as follows:\n ${CCP-CLI} get pod pr-primary -o json | grep -C 1 'PG_USER\\|PG_PASSWORD\\|PG_DATABASE'   This will give you the environment variable values for the database created by default in addition to the username and password of the standard user.\n   PG_USER\n  PG_PASSWORD\n  PG_DATABASE\n    Kubernetes Secrets You can use Kubernetes Secrets to set and maintain your database credentials. Secrets requires you base64 encode your user and password values as follows:\n echo -n 'myuserid' | base64   You will paste these values into your JSON secrets files for values.\n This example allows you to set the PostgreSQL passwords using Kubernetes Secrets.\n The secret uses a base64 encoded string to represent the values to be read by the container during initialization. The encoded password value is password. Run the example as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/secret ./run.sh   The secrets are mounted in the /pguser, /pgprimary, and /pgroot volumes within the container and read during initialization. The container scripts create a PostgreSQL user with those values, and sets the passwords for the primary user and PostgreSQL superuser using the mounted secret volumes.\n When using secrets, you do NOT have to specify the following environment variables if you specify all three secrets volumes:\n   PG_USER\n  PG_PASSWORD\n  PG_ROOT_PASSWORD\n  PG_PRIMARY_USER\n  PG_PRIMARY_PASSWORD\n   You can test the container as follows. In all cases, the password is password:\n psql -h secret -U pguser1 postgres psql -h secret -U postgres postgres psql -h secret -U primaryuser postgres    pgAdmin4 This example deploys the pgadmin4 v2 web user interface for PostgreSQL without TLS.\n After running the example, you should be able to browse to http://127.0.0.1:5050 and log into the web application using a user ID of admin@admin.com and password of password.\n If you are running this example using Kubernetes or OpenShift, replace 127.0.0.1:5050 with the \u0026lt;NODE_IP\u0026gt;:30000.\n To get the node IP, run the following:\n ${CCP_CLI} describe pod pgadmin4-http | grep Node:   See the pgAdmin4 documentation for more details.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker To run this example, run the following:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgadmin4-http ./run.sh    Kubernetes and OpenShift Start the container as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgadmin4-http ./run.sh   An emptyDir with write access must be mounted to the /run/httpd directory in OpenShift.\n     pgAdmin4 with TLS This example deploys the pgadmin4 v2 web user interface for PostgreSQL with TLS.\n After running the example, you should be able to browse to https://127.0.0.1:5050 and log into the web application using a user ID of admin@admin.com and password of password.\n If you are running this example using Kubernetes or OpenShift, replace 127.0.0.1:5050 with the \u0026lt;NODE_IP\u0026gt;:30000.\n To get the node IP, run the following:\n ${CCP_CLI} describe pod pgadmin4-https | grep Node:   See the pgadmin4 documentation for more details.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker To run this example, run the following:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgadmin4-https ./run.sh    Kubernetes and OpenShift Start the container as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgadmin4-https ./run.sh   An emptyDir with write access must be mounted to the /run/httpd directory in OpenShift.\n     pg_upgrade Starting in release 1.3.1, the upgrade container will let you perform a pg_upgrade either from a PostgreSQL version 9.5 database to 9.6 or from 9.6 to 10.\n This example assumes you have run primary using a PG 9.5 or 9.6 image such as centos7-9.5.13-2.0 prior to running this upgrade.\n Prior to starting this example, shut down the primary database using the examples/kube/primary/cleanup.sh script.\n Prior to running this example, make sure your CCP_IMAGE_TAG environment variable is using the next major version of PostgreSQL that you want to upgrade to. For example, if you\u0026#8217;re upgrading from 9.5 to 9.6, make sure the variable references a PG 9.6 image such as centos7-9.6.9-2.0.\n This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:\n   a Kubernetes Job running the crunchy-upgrade container\n  a new data directory name upgrade found in the pgnewdata PVC\n   Kubernetes and OpenShift Start the upgrade as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/upgrade ./run.sh   If successful, the Job will end with a successful status. Verify the results of the Job by examining the Job\u0026#8217;s pod log:\n ${CCP_CLI} get pod -a -l job-name=upgrade-job ${CCP_CLI} logs -l job-name=upgrade-job   You can verify the upgraded database by running the examples/kube/primary-upgrade example. This example will mount the newly created and upgraded database files. Database tables and data that were in the primary test database should be found in the primary-upgrade database.\n   Cron Scheduler The crunchy-dba container implements a cron scheduler. The purpose of the crunchy-dba container is to offer a way to perform simple DBA tasks that occur on some form of schedule such as backup jobs or running a vacuum on a single PostgreSQL database container (such as the primary example).\n You can either run the crunchy-dba container as a single pod or include the container within a database pod.\n The crunchy-dba container makes use of a Service Account to perform the startup of scheduled jobs. The Kubernetes Job type is used to execute the scheduled jobs with a Restart policy of Never.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Kubernetes and OpenShift The script to schedule vacuum on a regular schedule is executed through the following commands:\n # Kubernetes cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba ./run-kube-vac.sh # OpenShift cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba ./run-ocp-vac.sh   To run the script for scheduled backups, run the following in the same directory:\n # Kubernetes cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba ./run-kube-backup.sh # OpenShift cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba ./run-ocp-backup.sh   Individual parameters for both can be modified within their respective JSON files; please see the Container Specifications document for a full list of what can be modified.\n   Vacuum You can perform a PostgreSQL vacuum command by running the crunchy-vacuum container. You specify a database to vacuum using environment variables. By default, vacuum is executed against the primary example container.\n The crunchy-vacuum container image exists to allow a DBA a way to run a job either individually or scheduled to perform a variety of vacuum operations.\n This example performs a vacuum on a single table in the primary PostgreSQL database. The crunchy-vacuum image is executed with the PostgreSQL connection parameters to the single-primary PostgreSQL container. The type of vacuum performed is dictated by the environment variables passed into the job; these are defined with further detail here.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker Run the example as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/vacuum ./run.sh    Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/vacuum/ ./run.sh   Verify the job is completed:\n ${CCP_CLI} get job     systemd The crunchy-pg.service is an example of a systemd unit file that starts and stops a container named crunchy-pg that has already been created.\n The example scripts are located in the following directory:\n $CCPROOT/examples/systemd/   There are two scripts within the directory.\n test-start.sh   This script is called by the systemd start execution. The trick with this script is that it blocks forever after starting the docker crunchy-pg container. The blocking in the script keeps systemd happy and thinking that this is a normal daemon.\n test-stop.sh   This script stops the test-start.sh script and also stops the crunchy-pg Docker container.\n    Backup and Restoration pg_dump The script assumes you are going to backup the primary example and that container is running.\n This example assumes you have configured a storage filesystem as described in the Storage Configuration document.\n A successful backup will perform pg_dump/pg_dumpall on the primary and store the resulting files in the mounted volume under a directory named \u0026lt;HOSTNAME\u0026gt;-backups as a sub-directory, then followed by a unique backup directory based upon a date and timestamp - allowing any number of backups to be kept.\n For more information on how to configure this container, please see the Container Specifications document.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker Run the backup with this command:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgdump ./run.sh    Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgdump ./run.sh   The Kubernetes Job type executes a pod and then the pod exits. You can view the Job status using this command:\n ${CCP_CLI} get job   The pgdump.json file within that directory specifies options that control the behavior of the pgdump job. Examples of this include whether to run pg_dump vs pg_dumpall and advanced options for specific backup use cases.\n   pg_restore The script assumes you are going to restore to the primary example and that container is running and a backup has been created using the pgdump example..\n This example assumes you have configured a storage filesystem as described in the Storage Configuration document.\n Successful use of the crunchy-pgrestore container will run a job to restore files generated by pg_dump/pg_dumpall to a container via psql/pg_restore; then container will terminate successfully and signal job completion.\n For more information on how to configure this container, please see the Container Specifications document.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker Run the restore with this command:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgrestore ./run.sh    Kubernetes and OpenShift By default, pgrestore container will automatically restore from the most recent backup. If you want to restore to a specific backup, edit the pgrestore.json file and update the PGRESTORE_BACKUP_TIMESTAMP setting to specify the backup path you want to restore with. For example:\n \"name\":\"PGRESTORE_BACKUP_TIMESTAMP\", \"value\":\"2018-03-27-14-35-33\"   Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgrestore ./run.sh   The Kubernetes Job type executes a pod and then the pod exits. You can view the Job status using this command:\n ${CCP_CLI} get job   The pgrestore.json file within that directory specifies options that control the behavior of the pgrestore job.\n   pgBackRest pgbackrest is a utility that performs a backup, restore, and archive function for a PostgreSQL database. pgbackrest is written and maintained by David Steele, and more information can be found on the official website.\n Backups are currently performed by manually executing pgbackrest commands against the desired pod. Restores can now be performed via the crunchy-backrest-restore container, which offers FULL or DELTA restore capability.\n pgbackrest is configured using a pgbackrest.conf file that is mounted into the crunchy-postgres container at /pgconf.\n If you place a pgbackrest.conf file within this mounted directory, it will trigger the use of pgbackrest within the PostgreSQL container as the archive_command and will turn on the archive_mode to begin archival. It is still required to define the ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT environment variable within your container configuration as it is set to a disable value of 0 by default.\n The following changes will be made to the container\u0026#8217;s postgresql.conf file:\n ARCHIVE_MODE=on ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT=60 ARCHIVE_COMMAND='pgbackrest --stanza=db archive-push %p'   If you are using a crunchy-postgres image older than 1.7.1, archive_command must specify where the pgbackrest.conf file is located:\n ARCHIVE_COMMAND='pgbackrest --config=/pgconf/pgbackrest.conf --stanza=db archive-push %p'   This requires you use a pgbackrest stanza name of db within the pgbackrest.conf file you mount.\n When set, WAL files generated by the database will be written out to the /backrestrepo mount point.\n Kubernetes and OpenShift Start the example as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest ./run.sh   This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:\n   configMap named backrest-pgconf which contains the pgbackrest.conf file\n  backrest pod with pgbackrest archive enabled and an initial stanza db created on initialization\n  backrest service\n  backrest-pgdata PVC which is used for /pgdata\n  backrest-backrestrepo PVC which is used for /backrestrepo\n   Examine the /backrestrepo location to view the archive directory and ensure WAL archiving is working.\n You can create a backup using backrest using this command within the container:\n ${CCP_CLI} exec -it backrest bash pgbackrest --stanza=db backup    Restore There are two options to choose from when performing a restore, DELTA and FULL. A FULL is the default; a DELTA will only occur if the environment variable DELTA is specified in the restore-job spec. Consult the pgbackrest user guide to determine which is best suited to run.\n Steps for FULL restore\n   Delete the backrest pod, if still running using\n  Empty the PGDATA directory (remove all files)\n  Navigate to the backrest-restore examples directory. Execute the full-restore.sh script.\n  Check the restore logs for the container to verify success. You can also view the logs of the completed job pod with ${CCP_CLI} get pod -a\n  Re-create the backrest pod in the backrest examples directory. The database will recover.\n   Steps for DELTA restore\n   Delete the backrest pod, if still running\n  rm postmaster.pid from PGDATA.\n  Navigate to the backrest-restore examples directory. Execute the delta-restore.sh script.\n  Check the restore logs for the container to verify success. You can also view the logs of the completed job pod with ${CCP_CLI} get pod -a\n  Re-create the backrest pod in the backrest examples directory. The database will recover only files that have changed from the last backup.\n     pgBackRest with SSHD The PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL GIS containers can enable an SSH daemon to allow developers to do DBA tasks on the database server without the need for exec privileges. An administrator who deploys the SSHD enabled PostgreSQL database can specify the authorized public keys for access to the database server.\n In order to activate SSHD in the PostgreSQL containers, the following files need to be mounted to the PostgreSQL container:\n   SSH Host keys mounted on the /sshd volume. Three keys are required:\n  ssh_host_rsa_key\n  ssh_host_ecdsa_key\n  ssh_host_ed25519_key\n     sshd_config mounted on the /pgconf volume\n  authorized_keys mounted on the /pgconf volume\n   SSHD can be enabled in the PostgreSQL containers by adding the following line:\n ENABLE_SSHD=true   The authorized_keys file is mounted on the /pgconf directory. In order to support using this mount for authentication the following must be set in sshd_config:\n AuthorizedKeysFile /pgconf/authorized_keys StrictModes no   For OpenShift deployments, the following configuration needs to be set in sshd_config:\n UsePAM no   Docker Start the example as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/postgres-sshd ./run.sh   This will create the following in your Docker environment:\n   A volume named pgconf which contains the pgbackrest.conf, pg_hba.conf, postgresql.conf, sshd_config, authorized_keys file\n  A volume named sshd containing the SSH Host keys\n  postgres-sshd container pgbackrest archive and sshd enabled. An initial stanza db will be created on initialization\n   After running the example, SSH to the container using the forwarded port 2022:\n ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@0.0.0.0    Kubernetes / OpenShift Start the example as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/postgres-sshd ./run.sh   This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:\n   A configMap named pgconf which contains the pgbackrest.conf, pg_hba.conf, postgresql.conf, sshd_config, authorized_keys file\n  A secret named sshd-secrets containing the SSH Host keys\n  postgres-sshd pod with pgbackrest archive and sshd enabled. An initial stanza db will be created on initialization\n  postgres-sshd service with port 2022 for SSH\n   After running the example, SSH to the service using the postgres-sshd service available in Kubernetes:\n ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@postgres-sshd    Using pgBackrest via SSH If a pgbackrest.conf file is located on the /pgconf volume and archiving is enabled, it\u0026#8217;s possible to run backups using the pgBackrest utility.\n With the SSHD service running, the following command will issue a pgBackrest backup.\n ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@postgres-sshd pgbackrest --stanza=db backup   To list all the available pgBackrest backups, run the following:\n ssh -i ./keys/id_rsa -p 2022 postgres@postgres-sshd pgbackrest info     pg_basebackup The script assumes you are going to backup the primary container created in the first example, so you need to ensure that container is running. This example assumes you have configured storage as described in the Storage Configuration documentation. Things to point out with this example include its use of persistent volumes and volume claims to store the backup data files.\n A successful backup will perform pg_basebackup on the primary container and store the backup in the $CCP_STORAGE_PATH volume under a directory named primary-backups. Each backup will be stored in a subdirectory with a timestamp as the name, allowing any number of backups to be kept.\n The backup script will do the following:\n   Start up a backup container named backup\n  Run pg_basebackup on the container named primary\n  Store the backup in the /tmp/backups/primary-backups directory\n  Exit after the backup\n   When you are ready to restore from the backup, the restore example runs a PostgreSQL container using the backup location. Upon initialization, the container will use rsync to copy the backup data to this new container and then launch PostgreSQL using the original backed-up data.\n The restore script will do the following:\n   Start up a container named restore\n  Copy the backup files from the previous backup example into /pgdata\n  Start up the container using the backup files\n  Map the PostgreSQL port of 5432 in the container to your local host port of 12001\n   To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker Run the backup with this command:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backup ./run.sh   When you\u0026#8217;re ready to restore, a restore example is provided.\n It\u0026#8217;s required to specified a backup path for this example. To get the correct path check the backup job logs or a timestamp:\n docker logs backup-vpk9l | grep BACKUP_PATH Wed May 9 20:32:00 UTC 2018 INFO: BACKUP_PATH is set to /pgdata/primary-backups/2018-05-09-20-32-00.   BACKUP_PATH can also be discovered by looking at the backup mount directly (if access to the storage is available to the user).\n An example of BACKUP_PATH is as followed:\n \"name\": \"BACKUP_PATH\", \"value\": \"primary-backups/2018-05-09-20-32-00\"   When you are ready to restore from the backup created, run the following example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/restore ./run.sh    Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backup ./run.sh   The Kubernetes Job type executes a pod and then the pod exits. You can view the Job status using this command:\n ${CCP_CLI} get job   When you\u0026#8217;re ready to restore, a restore example is provided.\n It\u0026#8217;s required to specified a backup path for this example. To get the correct path check the backup job logs or a timestamp:\n kubectl logs backup-vpk9l | grep BACKUP_PATH Wed May 9 20:32:00 UTC 2018 INFO: BACKUP_PATH is set to /pgdata/primary-backups/2018-05-09-20-32-00.   BACKUP_PATH can also be discovered by looking at the backup mount directly (if access to the storage is available to the user).\n An example of BACKUP_PATH defined as a variable within the JSON script is as follows:\n \"name\": \"BACKUP_PATH\", \"value\": \"primary-backups/2018-05-09-20-32-00\"   Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/restore ./run.sh   Test the restored database as follows:\n psql -h restore -U postgres postgres     Point in Time Recovery (PITR) PITR (point-in-time-recovery) is a feature that allows for recreating a database from backup and log files at a certain point in time. This is done using a write ahead log (WAL) which is kept in the pg_wal directory within PGDATA. Changes made to the database files over time are recorded in these log files, which allows it to be used for disaster recovery purposes.\n When using PITR as a backup method, in order to restore from the last checkpoint in the event of a database or system failure, it is only necessary to save these log files plus a full backup. This provides an additional advantage in that it is not necessary to keep multiple full backups on hand, which consume space and time to create. This is because point in time recovery allows you to \"replay\" the log files and recover your database to any point since the last full backup.\n More detailed information about Write Ahead Log (WAL) archiving can be found here.\n By default in the crunchy-postgres container, WAL logging is not enabled. To enable WAL logging outside of this example, set the following environment variables when starting the crunchy-postgres container:\n ARCHIVE_MODE=on ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT=60   These variables set the same name settings within the postgresql.conf file that is used by the database. When set, WAL files generated by the database will be written out to the /pgwal mount point.\n A full backup is required to do a PITR. crunchy-backup currently performs this role within the example, running a pg_basebackup on the database. This is a requirement for PITR. After a backup is performed, code is added into crunchy-postgres which will also check to see if you want to do a PITR.\n There are three volume mounts used with the PITR example.\n   /recover - When specified within a crunchy-postgres container, PITR is activated during container startup.\n  /backup - This is used to find the base backup you want to recover from.\n  /pgwal - This volume is used to write out new WAL files from the newly restored database container.\n   Some environment variables used to manipulate the point in time recovery logic:\n   The RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME environment variable is used to tell the PITR logic what the name of the target is.\n  RECOVERY_TARGET_TIME is also an optional environment variable that restores using a known time stamp.\n   If you don\u0026#8217;t specify either of these environment variables, then the PITR logic will assume you want to restore using all the WAL files or essentially the last known recovery point.\n The RECOVERY_TARGET_INCLUSIVE environment variable is also available to let you control the setting of the recovery.conf setting recovery_target_inclusive. If you do not set this environment variable the default is true.\n Once you recover a database using PITR, it will be in read-only mode. To make the database resume as a writable database, run the following SQL command:\n postgres=# select pg_wal_replay_resume();   If you\u0026#8217;re running the PITR example for PostgreSQL versions 9.5 or 9.6, please note that starting in PostgreSQL version 10, the pg_xlog directory was renamed to pg_wal. Additionally, all usages of the function pg_xlog_replay_resume were changed to pg_wal_replay_resume.\n   It takes about 1 minute for the database to become ready for use after initially starting.\n WAL segment files are written to the /tmp directory. Leaving the example running for a long time could fill up your /tmp directory.\n   To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker Create a database container as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pitr ./run-pitr.sh   Next, we will create a base backup of that database using this:\n ./run-backup-pitr.sh   After creating the base backup of the database, WAL segment files are created every 60 seconds that contain any database changes. These segments are stored in the /tmp/pitr/pitr/pg_wal directory.\n Next, create some recovery targets within the database by running the SQL commands against the pitr database as follows:\n ./run-sql.sh   This will create recovery targets named beforechanges, afterchanges, and nomorechanges. It will create a table, pitrtest, between the beforechanges and afterchanges targets. It will also run a SQL CHECKPOINT to flush out the changes to WAL segments. These labels can be used to mark the points in the recovery process that will be referenced when creating the restored database.\n Next, now that we have a base backup and a set of WAL files containing our database changes, we can shut down the pitr database to simulate a database failure. Do this by running the following:\n docker stop pitr   Next, let\u0026#8217;s edit the restore script to use the base backup files created in the step above. You can view the backup path name under the /tmp/backups/pitr-backups/ directory. You will see another directory inside of this path with a name similar to 2018-03-21-21-03-29. Copy and paste that value into the run-restore-pitr.sh script in the BACKUP environment variable.\n After that, run the script.\n vi ./run-restore-pitr.sh ./run-restore-pitr.sh   The WAL segments are read and applied when restoring from the database backup. At this point, you should be able to verify that the database was restored to the point before creating the test table:\n psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'   This SQL command should show that the pitrtest table does not exist at this recovery time. The output should be similar to:\n ERROR: relation \"pitrtest\" does not exist   PostgreSQL allows you to pause the recovery process if the target name or time is specified. This pause would allow a DBA a chance to review the recovery time/name and see if this is what they want or expect. If so, the DBA can run the following command to resume and complete the recovery:\n psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'select pg_wal_replay_resume()'   Until you run the statement above, the database will be left in read-only mode.\n Next, run the script to restore the database to the afterchanges restore point. Update the RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME to afterchanges:\n vi ./run-restore-pitr.sh ./run-restore-pitr.sh   After this restore, you should be able to see the test table:\n psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest' psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'select pg_wal_replay_resume()'   Lastly, start a recovery using all of the WAL files. This will get the restored database as current as possible. To do so, edit the script to remove the RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME environment setting completely:\n ./run-restore-pitr.sh sleep 30 psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest' psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'   At this point, you should be able to create new data in the restored database and the test table should be present. When you recover the entire WAL history, resuming the recovery is not necessary to enable writes.\n  Kubernetes and OpenShift Start by running the example database container:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pitr ./run-pitr.sh   This step will create a database container, pitr. This container is configured to continuously write WAL segment files to a mounted volume (/pgwal).\n After you start the database, you will create a base backup using this command:\n ./run-backup-pitr.sh   This will create a backup and write the backup files to a persistent volume (/pgbackup).\n Next, create some recovery targets within the database by running the SQL commands against the pitr database as follows:\n ./run-sql.sh   This will create recovery targets named beforechanges, afterchanges, and nomorechanges. It will create a table, pitrtest, between the beforechanges and afterchanges targets. It will also run a SQL CHECKPOINT to flush out the changes to WAL segments.\n Next, now that we have a base backup and a set of WAL files containing our database changes, we can shut down the pitr database to simulate a database failure. Do this by running the following:\n ${CCP_CLI} delete pod pitr   Next, we will create 3 different restored database containers based upon the base backup and the saved WAL files.\n First, get the BACKUP_PATH created by the backup-pitr example by viewing the pods logs:\n ${CCP_CLI} logs backup-pitr-8sfkh | grep PATH Thu May 10 18:07:58 UTC 2018 INFO: BACKUP_PATH is set to /pgdata/pitr-backups/2018-05-10-18-07-58.   Edit the restore-pitr.json file and change the BACKUP_PATH environment variable using the path discovered above (note: /pgdata/ is not required and should be excluded in the variable):\n { \"name\": \"BACKUP_PATH\", \"value\": \"pitr-backups/2018-05-10-18-07-58\" {   Next, we restore prior to the beforechanges recovery target. This recovery point is before the pitrtest table is created.\n Edit the restore-pitr.json file, and edit the environment variable to indicate we want to use the beforechanges recovery point:\n { \"name\": \"RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME\", \"value\": \"beforechanges\" {   Then run the following to create the restored database container:\n ./run-restore-pitr.sh   After the database has restored, you should be able to perform a test to see if the recovery worked as expected:\n psql -h restore-pitr -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest' psql -h restore-pitr -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'   The output of these commands should show that the pitrtest table is not present. It should also show that you can not create a new table because the database is paused in read-only mode.\n To make the database resume as a writable database, run the following SQL command:\n select pg_wal_replay_resume();   It should then be possible to write to the database:\n psql -h restore-pitr -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'   You can also test that if afterchanges is specified, that the pitrtest table is present but that the database is still in recovery mode.\n Lastly, you can test a full recovery using all of the WAL files, if you remove the RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME environment variable completely.\n The storage portions of this example can all be found under $CCP_STORAGE_PATH.\n     Connection Pooling pgBouncer The pgBouncer utility can be used to provide a connection pool to PostgreSQL databases.\n This example configures pgBouncer to provide connection pooling for the pg-primary and pg-replica databases.\n On Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift, the example will deploy a primary-replica equivalent set of pods and related services.\n A storage filesystem is required to mount the pgBouncer configuration files which are then mounted to /pgconf in the crunchy-pgbouncer container.\n If you mount a /pgconf volume, crunchy-postgres will look at that directory for postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, and setup.sql. If it finds one of them it will use that file instead of the default files.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker The pgbouncer example is run as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgbouncer ./run.sh   To log into the databases from the pgBouncer connection pool you would enter the following using the default password password:\n psql -h localhost -p 6543 -U testuser pg-primary psql -h localhost -p 6543 -U testuser pg-replica    Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgbouncer ./run.sh   To log into the database from the pgBouncer connection pool you would enter the following using the default password password:\n psql -h pgbouncer -U postgres pg-primary -p 6543 psql -h pgbouncer -U postgres pg-replica -p 6543   View the pgBouncer log as follows:\n ${CCP_CLI} log pgbouncer     pgPool II An example is provided that will run a pgPool II container in conjunction with the primary-replica example provided above.\n You can execute both INSERT and SELECT statements after connecting to pgpool. The container will direct INSERT statements to the primary and SELECT statements will be sent round-robin to both the primary and replica.\n The container creates a default database called userdb, a default user called testuser and a default password of password.\n You can view the nodes that pgpool is configured for by running:\n psql -h pgpool -U testuser userdb -c 'show pool_nodes'   To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker Create the container as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgpool ./run.sh   The example is configured to allow the testuser to connect to the userdb database.\n psql -h localhost -U testuser -p 12003 userdb    Kubernetes and OpenShift Run the following command to deploy the pgpool service:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgpool ./run.sh   The example is configured to allow the testuser to connect to the userdb database.\n psql -h pgpool -U testuser userdb       Database Single Primary This example starts a single PostgreSQL container and service, the most simple of examples.\n The container creates a default database called userdb, a default user called testuser and a default password of password.\n For all environments, the script additionally creates:\n   A persistent volume claim\n  A crunchy-postgres container named primary\n  The database using predefined environment variables\n   And specifically for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:\n   A pod named primary\n  A service named primary\n  A PVC named primary-pgdata\n  The database using predefined environment variables\n   To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker To create the example and run the container:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary ./run.sh   Connect from your local host as follows:\n psql -h localhost -U testuser -W userdb    Kubernetes and OpenShift To create the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary ./run.sh   Connect from your local host as follows:\n psql -h primary -U postgres postgres    Helm This example resides under the $CCPROOT/examples/helm directory. View the README to run this example using Helm here.\n   PostgreSQL Deployment Starting in release 1.2.8, the PostgreSQL container can accept an environment variable named PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE. If set, the /pgdata/subdir path will use a subdirectory name of your choosing instead of the default which is the hostname of the container.\n This example shows how a Deployment of a PostgreSQL primary is supported. A pod is a deployment that uses a hostname generated by Kubernetes; because of this, a new hostname will be defined upon restart of the primary pod.\n For finding the /pgdata that pertains to the pod, you will need to specify a /pgdata/subdir name that never changes. This requirement is handled by the PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE environment variable.\n The container creates a default database called userdb, a default user called testuser and a default password of password.\n This example will create the following in your Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:\n   primary-deployment service which uses a PVC to persist PostgreSQL data\n  replica-deployment service, uses emptyDir persistence\n  primary-deployment deployment of replica count 1 for the primary PostgreSQL database pod\n  replica-deployment deployment of replica count 1 for the replica\n  replica2-deployment deployment of replica count 1 for the 2nd replica\n  ConfigMap to hold a custom postgresql.conf, setup.sql, and pg_hba.conf files\n  Secrets for the primary user, superuser, and normal user to hold the passwords\n  Volume mount for /pgbackrest and /pgwal\n   The persisted data for the PostgreSQL primary is found under /pgdata/primary-deployment. If you delete the primary pod, the deployment will create another pod for the primary and will be able to start up immediately since it works out of the same /pgdata/primary-deployment data directory.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Kubernetes and OpenShift Start the example as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-deployment ./run.sh     Replication This example starts a primary and a replica pod containing a PostgreSQL database.\n The container creates a default database called userdb, a default user called testuser and a default password of password.\n For the Docker environment, the script additionally creates:\n   A docker volume using the local driver for the primary\n  A docker volume using the local driver for the replica\n  A container named primary binding to port 12007\n  A container named replica binding to port 12008\n  A mapping of the PostgreSQL port 5432 within the container to the localhost port 12000\n  The database using predefined environment variables\n   And specifically for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:\n   emptyDir volumes for persistence\n  A pod named pr-primary\n  A pod named pr-replica\n  A pod named pr-replica-2\n  A service named pr-primary\n  A service named pr-replica\n  The database using predefined environment variables\n   To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker To create the example and run the container:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary-replica ./run.sh   Connect from your local host as follows:\n psql -h localhost -p 12007 -U testuser -W userdb psql -h localhost -p 12008 -U testuser -W userdb    Docker-Compose Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/compose/primary-replica docker-compose up   To deploy more than one replica, run the following:\n docker-compose up --scale db-replica=3   To connect to the created database containers, first identify the ports exposed on the containers:\n docker ps   Next, using psql, connect to the service:\n psql -d userdb -h 0.0.0.0 -p \u0026lt;CONTAINER_PORT\u0026gt; -U testuser   See PG_PASSWORD in docker-compose.yml for the user password.\n   To tear down the example, run the following:\n docker-compose stop docker-compose rm    Kubernetes and OpenShift Run the following command to deploy a primary and replica database cluster:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica ./run.sh   It takes about a minute for the replica to begin replicating with the primary. To test out replication, see if replication is underway with this command:\n psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'   If you see a line returned from that query it means the primary is replicating to the replica. Try creating some data on the primary:\n psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)' psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'   Then verify that the data is replicated to the replica:\n psql -h pr-replica -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'   primary-replica-dc\n If you wanted to experiment with scaling up the number of replicas, you can run the following example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica-dc ./run.sh   You can verify that replication is working using the same commands as above.\n This example creates 2 replicas when it initially starts. To scale up the number of replicas and view what the deployment looks like before and after, run these commands:\n ${CCP_CLI} get deployment ${CCP_CLI} scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=3 deployment/replica-dc ${CCP_CLI} get deployment ${CCP_CLI} get pod   You can verify that you now have 3 replicas by running this query on the primary:\n psql -h primary-dc -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'    Helm This example resides under the $CCPROOT/examples/helm directory. View the README to run this example using Helm here.\n   Synchronous Replication This example deploys a PostgreSQL cluster with a primary, a synchronous replica, and an asynchronous replica. The two replicas share the same service.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker To run this example, run the following:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/sync ./run.sh   You can test the replication status on the primary by using the following command and the password password:\n psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'   You should see 2 rows; 1 for the asynchronous replica and 1 for the synchronous replica. The sync_state column shows values of async or sync.\n You can test replication to the replicas by first entering some data on the primary, and secondly querying the replicas for that data:\n psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)' psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)' psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12011 -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo' psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12012 -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'    Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/sync ./run.sh   Connect to the primarysync and replicasync databases as follows for both the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:\n psql -h primarysync -U postgres postgres -c 'create table test (id int)' psql -h primarysync -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into test values (1)' psql -h primarysync -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication' psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from test' psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from test' psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from test'   This set of queries will show you the IP address of the PostgreSQL replica container. Note the changing IP address due to the round-robin service proxy being used for both replicas. The example queries also show that both replicas are replicating successfully from the primary.\n   Statefulsets This example deploys a statefulset named statefulset. The statefulset is a new feature in Kubernetes as of version 1.5 and in OpenShift Origin as of version 3.5. Statefulsets have replaced PetSets going forward.\n Please view this Kubernetes description to better understand what a Statefulset is and how it works.\n This example creates 2 PostgreSQL containers to form the set. At startup, each container will examine its hostname to determine if it is the first container within the set of containers.\n The first container is determined by the hostname suffix assigned by Kubernetes to the pod. This is an ordinal value starting with 0. If a container sees that it has an ordinal value of 0, it will update the container labels to add a new label of:\n name=$PG_PRIMARY_HOST   In this example, PG_PRIMARY_HOST is specified as statefulset-primary.\n By default, the containers specify a value of name=statefulset-replica.\n There are 2 services that end user applications will use to access the PostgreSQL cluster, one service (statefulset-primary) routes to the primary container and the other (statefulset-replica) to the replica containers.\n $ ${CCP_CLI} get service NAME CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE kubernetes 10.96.0.1 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 443/TCP 22h statefulset None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5432/TCP 1h statefulset-primary 10.97.168.138 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5432/TCP 1h statefulset-replica 10.97.218.221 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5432/TCP 1h   To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Kubernetes and OpenShift Start the example as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/statefulset ./run.sh   You can access the primary database as follows:\n psql -h statefulset-primary -U postgres postgres   You can access the replica databases as follows:\n psql -h statefulset-replica -U postgres postgres   You can scale the number of containers using this command; this will essentially create an additional replica database.\n ${CCP_CLI} scale --replicas=3 statefulset statefulset    Helm This example resides under the $CCPROOT/examples/helm directory. View the README to run this example using Helm here.\n   Geospatial (PostGIS) An example is provided that will run a PostgreSQL with PostGIS pod and service in Kubernetes and OpenShift and a container in Docker.\n The container creates a default database called userdb, a default user called testuser and a default password of password.\n You can view the extensions that postgres-gis has enabled by running the following command and viewing the listed PostGIS packages:\n psql -h postgres-gis -U testuser userdb -c '\\dx'   To validate that PostGIS is installed and which version is running, run the command:\n psql -h postgres-gis -U testuser userdb -c \"SELECT postgis_full_version();\"   You should expect to see output similar to:\n postgis_full_version ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- POSTGIS=\"2.4.2 r16113\" PGSQL=\"100\" GEOS=\"3.5.0-CAPI-1.9.0 r4084\" PROJ=\"Rel. 4.8.0, 6 March 2012\" GDAL=\"GDAL 1.11.4, released 2016/01/25\" LIBXML=\"2.9.1\" LIBJSON=\"0.11\" TOPOLOGY RASTER (1 row)   As an exercise for invoking some of the basic PostGIS functionality for validation, try defining a 2D geometry point while giving inputs of longitude and latitude through this command.\n psql -h postgres-gis -U testuser userdb -c \"select ST_MakePoint(28.385200,-81.563900);\"   You should expect to see output similar to:\n  st_makepoint -------------------------------------------- 0101000000516B9A779C623C40B98D06F0166454C0 (1 row)   To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker Create the container as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/postgres-gis ./run.sh   Enter the following command to connect to the postgres-gis container that is mapped to your local port 12000:\n psql -h localhost -U testuser -p 12000 userdb    Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/postgres-gis ./run.sh     Custom Configuration You can use your own version of the SQL file setup.sql to customize the initialization of database data and objects when the container and database are created.\n This works by placing a file named setup.sql within the /pgconf mounted volume directory. Portions of the setup.sql file are required for the container to work; please see comments within the sample setup.sql file.\n If you mount a /pgconf volume, crunchy-postgres will look at that directory for postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, pg_ident.conf, SSL server/ca certificates and setup.sql. If it finds one of them it will use that file instead of the default files.\n Docker This example can be run as follows for the Docker environment:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/custom-config ./run.sh    Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config ./run.sh     SSL Authentication This example shows how you can configure PostgreSQL to use SSL for client authentication.\n The example requires SSL certificates and keys to be created. Included in the examples directory is a script to create self-signed certificates (server and client) for the example: $CCPROOT/examples/ssl-creator.sh.\n The example creates a client certificate for the user testuser. Furthermore, the server certificate is created for the server name custom-config-ssl.\n If as a client it\u0026#8217;s required to confirm the identity of the server, verify-full can be specified in the connection string. This will check if the server and the server certificate have the same name:\n psql postgresql://custom-config-ssl:5432/postgres?sslmode=verify-full -U testuser\"   To connect via IP, sslmode can be changed to require.\n psql postgresql://IP_OF_PGSQL:5432/postgres?sslmode=require -U testuser\"   This example can be run as follows for the Docker environment:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/custom-config-ssl ./run.sh   And the example can be run in the following directory for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl ./run.sh   A required step to make this example work is to define in your /etc/hosts file an entry that maps custom-config-ssl to the service IP address for the container.\n For instance, if your service has an address as follows:\n ${CCP_CLI} get service NAME CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE custom-config-ssl 172.30.211.108 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5432/TCP   Then your /etc/hosts file needs an entry like this:\n 172.30.211.108 custom-config-ssl   For production Kubernetes and OpenShift installations, it will likely be preferred for DNS names to resolve to the PostgreSQL service name and generate server certificates using the DNS names instead of the example name custom-config-ssl.\n In order to connect via certificate, environment variables must be set that point to the client certificates. Source the env.sh file to set environment varaibles for the example:\n source env.sh   If as a client it\u0026#8217;s required to confirm the identity of the server, verify-full can be specified in the connection string. This will check if the server and the server certificate have the same name:\n psql postgresql://custom-config-ssl:5432/userdb?sslmode=verify-full -U testuser\"   To connect via IP, sslmode can be changed to require.\n psql postgresql://IP_OF_PGSQL:5432/userdb?sslmode=require -U testuser\"   You should see a connection that looks like the following:\n psql (10.4) SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off) Type \"help\" for help. userdb=\u0026gt;    Docker Swarm This example shows how to run a primary and replica database container on a Docker Swarm (v.1.12) cluster.\n First, set up a cluster. The Kubernetes libvirt coreos cluster example works well; see coreos-libvirt-cluster.\n Next, on each node, create the Swarm using these Swarm Install instructions.\n Include this command on the manager node:\n docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.10.1   Then this command on all the worker nodes:\n  docker swarm join \\ --token SWMTKN-1-65cn5wa1qv76l8l45uvlsbprogyhlprjpn27p1qxjwqmncn37o-015egopg4jhtbmlu04faon82u \\ 192.168.10.1.37   Before creating Swarm services, it is necessary to define an overlay network to be used by the services you will create. This can be done as follows:\n docker network create --driver overlay crunchynet   We want to have the primary database always placed on a specific node. This is accomplished using node constraints as follows:\n docker node inspect kubernetes-node-1 | grep ID docker node update --label-add type=primary 18yrb7m650umx738rtevojpqy   In the above example, the kubernetes-node-1 node with ID 18yrb7m650umx738rtevojpqy has a user defined label of primary added to it. The primary service specifies primary as a constraint when created; this tells Swarm to place the service on that specific node. The replica specifies a constraint of node.labels.type != primary to have the replica always placed on a node that is not hosting the primary service.\n Docker After you set up the Swarm cluster, you can then run this example as follows on the Swarm Manager Node:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/swarm-service ./run.sh   You can then find the nodes that are running the primary and replica containers by:\n docker service ps primary docker service ps replica   You can also scale up the number of replica containers.\n docker service scale replica=2 docker service ls   Verify you have two replicas within PostgreSQL by viewing the pg_stat_replication table. The password is password by default when logged into the kubernetes-node-1 host:\n docker exec -it $(docker ps -q) psql -U postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication' postgres   You should see a row for each replica along with its replication status.\n     Failover Watch This example shows how to run the crunchy-watch container to perform an automated failover. For the example to work, the host on which you are running needs to allow read-write access to /run/docker.sock. The crunchy-watch container runs as the postgres user, so adjust the file permissions of /run/docker.sock accordingly.\n The primary-replica example is required to be run before this example.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker Run the example as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/watch ./run.sh   This will start the watch container which tests every few seconds whether the primary database is running, if not, it will trigger a failover using docker exec on the replica host.\n Test it out by stopping the primary:\n docker stop primary docker logs watch   Look at the watch container logs to see it perform the failover.\n  Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/watch ./run.sh   Check out the log of the watch container as follows:\n ${CCP_CLI} log watch   Then trigger a failover using this command:\n ${CCP_CLI} delete pod pr-primary   Resume watching the watch container\u0026#8217;s log and verify that it detects the primary is not reachable and performs a failover on the replica.\n A final test is to see if the old replica is now a fully functioning primary by inserting some test data into it as follows:\n psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'create table failtest (id int)'   The above command still works because the watch container has changed the labels of the replica to make it a primary, so the primary service will still work and route now to the new primary even though the pod is named replica.\n You can view the labels on a pod with this command:\n ${CCP_CLI} describe pod pr-replica | grep Label       Metrics and Performance pgBadger pgbadger is a PostgreSQL tool that reads the log files from a specified database in order to produce a HTML report that shows various PostgreSQL statistics and graphs. This example runs the pgbadger HTTP server against a crunchy-postgres container and illustrates how to view the generated reports.\n The port utilized for this tool is port 14000 for Docker environments and port 10000 for Kubernetes and OpenShift environments.\n A requirement to build this container from source is golang. On RHEL 7.2, golang is found in the 'server optional' repository which needs to be enabled in order to install this dependency.\n sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms   The container creates a default database called userdb, a default user called testuser and a default password of password.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker Run the example as follows:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgbadger ./run.sh   After execution, the container will run and provide a simple HTTP command you can browse to view the report. As you run queries against the database, you can invoke this URL to generate updated reports:\n curl -L http://127.0.0.1:14000/api/badgergenerate    Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgbadger ./run.sh   After execution, the container will run and provide a simple HTTP command you can browse to view the report. As you run queries against the database, you can invoke this URL to generate updated reports:\n curl -L http://badger:10000/api/badgergenerate   You can view the database container logs using these commands:\n ${CCP_CLI} logs pgbadger -c pgbadger ${CCP_CLI} logs pgbadger -c postgres     Metrics Collection You can collect various PostgreSQL metrics from your database container by running a crunchy-collect container that points to your database container.\n This example starts up 4 containers:\n   Collect (crunchy-collect)\n  Grafana (crunchy-grafana)\n  PostgreSQL (crunchy-postgres)\n  Prometheus (crunchy-prometheus)\n   Every 5 seconds by default, Prometheus will scrape the Collect container for metrics. These metrics will then be visualized by Grafana.\n By default, Prometheus detects which environment its running on (Docker, Kubernetes, or OpenShift Container Platform) and applies a default configuration. If this container is running on Kubernetes or OpenShift Container Platform, it will use the Kubernetes API to discover pods with the label \"crunchy-collect\": \"true\".\n The collect container must have this label to be discovered in these environments.\n Discovering pods requires a cluster role service account. See the Kubernetes and OpenShift metrics JSON file for more details.\n For Docker environments the collect hostname must be specified as an environment variable.\n To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:\n ./cleanup.sh   Docker To start this set of containers, run the following:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/metrics ./run.sh   You will be able to access the Grafana and Prometheus services from the following web addresses:\n   Grafana (http://0.0.0.0:3000)\n  Prometheus (http://0.0.0.0:9090)\n   The crunchy-postgres container is accessible on port 12015.\n  Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/metrics ./run.sh   You will be able to access the Grafana and Prometheus services from the following web addresses:\n   Grafana (http://NODE_IP_ADDRESS:30001)\n  Prometheus (http://NODE_IP_ADDRESS:30002)\n   You can view the container logs using these command:\n ${CCP_CLI} logs -c grafana metrics ${CCP_CLI} logs -c prometheus metrics ${CCP_CLI} logs -c collect pgsql ${CCP_CLI} logs -c postgres pgsql     pg_audit This example provides an example of enabling pg_audit output. As of release 1.3, pg_audit is included in the crunchy-postgres container and is added to the PostgreSQL shared library list in postgresql.conf.\n Given the numerous ways pg_audit can be configured, the exact pg_audit configuration is left to the user to define. pg_audit allows you to configure auditing rules either in postgresql.conf or within your SQL script.\n For this test, we place pg_audit statements within a SQL script and verify that auditing is enabled and working. If you choose to configure pg_audit via a postgresql.conf file, then you will need to define your own custom file and mount it to override the default postgresql.conf file.\n Docker Run the following to create a database container:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgaudit ./run.sh   This starts an instance of the pg_audit container (running crunchy-postgres) on port 12005 on localhost. The test script is then automatically executed.\n This test executes a SQL file which contains pg_audit configuration statements as well as executes some basic SQL commands. These SQL commands will cause pg_audit to create log messages in the pg_log log file created by the database container.\n  Kubernetes and OpenShift Run the following:\n cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgaudit ./run.sh   The script will create the pg_audit pod (running the crunchy-postgres container) on the Kubernetes instance and then execute a SQL file which contains pg_audit configuration statements as well as some basic SQL commands. These SQL commands will cause pg_audit to create log messages in the pg_log file created by the database container.\n     "
