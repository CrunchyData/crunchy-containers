== Example Conventions

The examples provided in Container Suite are simple examples that
are meant to demonstrate key Container Suite features.  These
examples can be used to build more production level deployments
as dictated by user requirements specific to their operating
environments.

The examples generally follow these conventions:

 * There is a *run.sh* script that you will execute to start the example.
 * There is a *cleanup.sh* script that you will execute to shutdown and cleanup the example.
 * Each example will create resources such as Secrets, ConfigMaps, Services, and PersistentVolumeClaims, all which follow a naming convention of *<example name>-<optional description suffix>*. For example an example called *primary* might have a PersistentVolumeClaim called *primary-pgconf* to describe the purpose of that particular PVC.
 * The folder names for each example give a clue as to which Container Suite feature it demonstrates. For instance, the `examples/kube/pgaudit` example demonstrates how to enable the pgaudit capability of the crunchy-postgres container.

== Usage

NOTE: The examples located in the `kube` directory work on both Kubernetes and OpenShift. Set the `CCP_CLI` environment variable
to the correct binary for your environment:

....
# Kubernetes
export CCP_CLI=kubectl

# OpenShift
export CCP_CLI=oc
....

Here are some useful resources for finding the right commands to troubleshoot & modify containers in
the various environments shown in this guide:

=== Environmental Custom Configurations

You can use your own version of the SQL file `setup.sql` to customize
the initialization of database data and objects when the container and
database are created.

This works by placing a file named `setup.sql` within the `/pgconf` mounted volume
directory.  Portions of the `setup.sql` file are required for the container
to work; please see comments within the sample `setup.sql` file.

If you mount a `/pgconf` volume, crunchy-postgres will look at that directory
for `postgresql.conf`, `pg_hba.conf`, and `setup.sql`.  If it finds one of them it
will use that file instead of the default files.  Currently, if you specify a `postgresql.conf`
file, you also need to specify a `pg_hba.conf` file.

This example can be run as follows for the Docker environment:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/custom-config
./run.sh
....

And the example can be run in the following directory for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config
./run.sh
....

===== SSL Authentication

This example shows how you can configure PostgreSQL to use SSL for
client authentication.

The example requires SSL keys to be created and the example script
`keys.sh` is required to be executed to create the required
server and client certificates. This script also creates
a client key configuration you can use to test with.

The example requires the storage volume, `/pgconf`, be mounted which
the PostgreSQL configuration files and keys are copied to.  Permissions
of the keys are important as well - they will need to be owned
by either the *root* or *postgres* user.  The `run.sh` script
copies the required files and sets these permissions when executing the example.

The `keys.sh` script creates a client cert with the *testuser* PostgreSQL user
specified as the CN.  The *testuser* PostgreSQL user is the role created by the
`setup.sql` configuration script on initialization as a testing account.

Run the PostgreSQL example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl
./run.sh
....

A required step to make this example work is to define
in your `/etc/hosts` file an entry that maps `server.crunchydata.com`
to the service IP address for the container. This is necessary due to the generation of
a server certificate while running the example.

For instance, if your service has an address as follows:
....
${CCP_CLI} get service
NAME                CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                   AGE
custom-config-ssl   172.30.211.108   <none>        5432/TCP
....

Then your `/etc/hosts` file needs an entry like this:
....
172.30.211.108 server.crunchydata.com
....

For production Kubernetes and OpenShift installations, it will likely be preferred for DNS
names to resolve to the PostgreSQL service name and generate
server certificates using the DNS names instead of the example
name `server.crunchydata.com`.

Once the container starts up, you can test the SSL connection
as follows:
....
psql -h server.crunchydata.com -U testuser userdb
....

You should see a connection that looks like the following:
....
psql (10.3)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

userdb=>
....

==== Tips

===== PostgreSQL Passwords

The passwords used for the PostgreSQL user accounts are generated
by the OpenShift `process` command.  To inspect what value is
supplied, you can inspect the primary pod as follows:

....
${CCP-CLI} get pod pr-primary -o json | grep -C 1 'PG_USER\|PG_PASSWORD\|PG_DATABASE'
....

This will give you the environment variable values for the database created by default
in addition to the username and password of the standard user.

 *  `PG_USER`
 *  `PG_PASSWORD`
 *  `PG_DATABASE`

===== Password Management

When you backup a database, the original user IDs and password credentials
are copied over from the original database and saved. Because of this, you
cannot use generated passwords as the new passwords will not be the same as the
passwords stored in the backup.

You have various options to deal with managing your passwords:

 * externalize your passwords using Secrets instead of using generated values
 * manually update your passwords to known values after a restore

NOTE: Environment variables can be modified when there is a deployment
or deployment controller in use.
....
${CCP-CLI} env dc/pg-primary-rc PG_PRIMARY_PASSWORD=foo PG_PRIMARY=user1
....

===== Examine Backup Logs

Database backups are implemented as a Kubernetes Job. These are meant to run one time only
and not be restarted by Kubernetes. To view jobs in OpenShift you enter:

....
${CCP-CLI} get jobs
${CCP-CLI} describe job backup
....

You can get detailed logs by referring to the pod identifier in the job 'describe'
output as follows:

....
${CCP-CLI} logs backup-pxh2o
....

===== Backups

Backups require the use of a storage mechanism in OpenShift.

There is a one-to-one relationship between a PV (persistent volume) and a PVC
(persistence volume claim).  You can NOT have a one-to-many relationship between
PV and PVC(s).

So, to do a database backup repeatedly, this general pattern will need to be followed.

 * as OpenShift administrative user, create a unique PV (e.g. backup-pv-mydatabase)
 * as a project user, create a unique PVC (e.g. backup-pvc-mydatabase)
 * reference the unique PVC within the backup template
 * execute the backup job template
 * as a project user, delete the job
 * as a project user, delete the PVC
 * as OpenShift administrative user, delete the unique PV

This procedure will need to be scripted and executed by the development team when
performing a database backup.

===== Restores

To perform a database restore, we do the following:

 * locate the storage path to the database backup we want to restore with
 * edit a PV to use that path
 * edit a PV to specify a unique label
 * create the PV
 * edit a PVC to use the previously created PV, specifying the same label
   used in the PV
 * edit a database template, specifying the PVC to be used for mounting
   to the `/backup` directory in the database pod
 * create the database pod

If the `/pgdata` directory is blank AND the `/backup` directory contains
a valid PostgreSQL backup, it is assumed the user wants to perform a
database restore.

The restore logic will copy `/backup` files to `/pgdata` before starting
the database.  It will take time for the copying of the files to
occur since this might be a large amount of data and the volumes
might be on slow networks. You can view the logs of the database pod
to measure the copy progress.

===== Log Aggregation

OpenShift can be configured to include the EFK stack for log aggregation.
OpenShift administrators can configure the EFK stack as documented
here:

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/aggregate_logging.html

===== Kubernetes Secrets

You can use Kubernetes Secrets to set and maintain your database
credentials.  Secrets requires you base64 encode your user and password
values as follows:

....
echo -n 'myuserid' | base64
....

You will paste these values into  your JSON secrets files for values.

This example allows you to set the PostgreSQL passwords
using Kubernetes Secrets.

The secret uses a base64 encoded string to represent the
values to be read by the container during initialization.  The
encoded password value is *password*.  Run the example
as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/secret
./run.sh
....

The secrets are mounted in the `/pguser`, `/pgprimary`, and `/pgroot` volumes within the
container and read during initialization.  The container
scripts create a PostgreSQL user with those values, and sets the passwords
for the primary user and PostgreSQL superuser using the mounted secret volumes.

When using secrets, you do NOT have to specify the following
environment variables if you specify all three secrets volumes:

 * `PG_USER`
 * `PG_PASSWORD`
 * `PG_ROOT_PASSWORD`
 * `PG_PRIMARY_USER`
 * `PG_PRIMARY_PASSWORD`

You can test the container as follows, in all cases, the password is *password*:
....
psql -h secret -U pguser1 postgres
psql -h secret -U postgres postgres
psql -h secret -U primaryuser postgres
....

== Container Examples

=== Running a Single Database

This example starts a single PostgreSQL container and service, the most simple
of examples.

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called *testuser*
and a default password of *password*.

For all environments, the script additionally creates:

 * A persistent volume claim
 * A crunchy-postgres container named *primary*
 * The database using predefined environment variables

And specifically for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:

 * A pod named *primary*
 * A service named *primary*
 * A PVC named *primary-pgdata*
 * The database using predefined environment variables

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To create the example and run the container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary
./run.sh
....

Connect from your local host as follows:
....
psql -h localhost -p 12000 -U testuser -W userdb
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

To create the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary
./run.sh
....

Connect from your local host as follows:
....
psql -h primary -U postgres postgres
....

==== Helm

This example resides under the `$CCPROOT/examples/helm` directory. View the README to run this
example using Helm link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/examples/helm/primary/README.md[here].

=== Creating a Primary / Replica Database Cluster

This example starts a primary and a replica pod containing a PostgreSQL database.

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called
*testuser* and a default password of *password*.

For the Docker environment, the script additionally creates:

 * A docker volume using the local driver for the primary
 * A docker volume using the local driver for the replica
 * A container named *primary* binding to port 12007
 * A container named *replica* binding to port 12008
 * A mapping of the PostgreSQL port 5432 within the container to the localhost port 12000
 * The database using predefined environment variables

And specifically for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:

 * emptyDir volumes for persistence
 * A pod named *pr-primary*
 * A pod named *pr-replica*
 * A pod named *pr-replica-2*
 * A service named *pr-primary*
 * A service named *pr-replica*
 * The database using predefined environment variables

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To create the example and run the container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary-replica
./run.sh
....

Connect from your local host as follows:
....
psql -h localhost -p 12007 -U testuser -W userdb
psql -h localhost -p 12008 -U testuser -W userdb
....

==== Docker-Compose

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/compose/primary-replica
docker-compose up
....

To deploy more than one replica, run the following:
....
docker-compose up --scale db-replica=3
....

To connect to the created database containers, first identify the ports exposed
on the containers:

....
docker ps
....

Next, using psql, connect to the service:
....
psql -d userdb -h 0.0.0.0 -p <CONTAINER_PORT> -U testuser
....

NOTE: See `PG_PASSWORD` in `docker-compose.yml` for the user password.

To tear down the example, run the following:
....
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Run the following command to deploy a primary and replica database cluster:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica
./run.sh
....

It takes about a minute for the replica to begin replicating with the
primary.  To test out replication, see if replication is underway
with this command:
....
psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

If you see a line returned from that query it means the primary is replicating
to the replica.  Try creating some data on the primary:
....
psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'
....

Then verify that the data is replicated to the replica:
....
psql -h pr-replica -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
....

*primary-replica-dc*

If you wanted to experiment with scaling up the number of replicas, you can run the following example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica-dc
./run.sh
....

You can verify that replication is working using the same commands as above.

This example creates 2 replicas when it initially starts.  To scale
up the number of replicas and view what the deployment looks like before and after, run these commands:
....
${CCP_CLI} get deployment
${CCP_CLI} scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=3 deployment/replica-dc
${CCP_CLI} get deployment
${CCP_CLI} get pod
....

You can verify that you now have 3 replicas by running this query
on the primary:
....
psql -h primary-dc -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

==== Helm

This example resides under the `$CCPROOT/examples/helm` directory. View the README to run this example
using Helm link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/examples/helm/primary-replica/README.md[here].

=== Primary / Replica Deployment

Starting in release 1.2.8, the PostgreSQL container can accept
an environment variable named `PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE`.  If set,
the `/pgdata/subdir` path will use a subdirectory name of your
choosing instead of the default which is the hostname of the container.

This example shows how a Deployment of a PostgreSQL primary is
supported. A pod is a deployment that uses a hostname generated by
Kubernetes; because of this, a new hostname will be defined upon
restart of the primary pod.

For finding the `/pgdata` that pertains to the pod, you will need
to specify a `/pgdata/subdir` name that never changes. This requirement is
handled by the `PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE` environment variable.

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called
*testuser* and a default password of *password*.

This example will create the following in your Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:

 * primary-deployment service which uses a PVC to persist PostgreSQL data
 * replica-deployment service, uses emptyDir persistence
 * primary-deployment deployment of replica count 1 for the primary
   PostgreSQL database pod
 * replica-deployment deployment of replica count 1 for the replica
 * replica2-deployment deployment of replica count 1 for the 2nd replica
 * ConfigMap to hold a custom `postgresql.conf`, `setup.sql`, and
   `pg_hba.conf` files
 * Secrets for the primary user, superuser, and normal user to
   hold the passwords
 * Volume mount for `/pgbackrest` and `/pgwal`

The persisted data for the PostgreSQL primary is found under `/pgdata/primary-deployment`.
If you delete the primary pod, the deployment will create another
pod for the primary and will be able to start up immediately since
it works out of the same `/pgdata/primary-deployment` data directory.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-deployment
./run.sh
....

=== Automated Failover

This example shows how to run the crunchy-watch container
to perform an automated failover.  For the example to
work, the host on which you are running needs to allow
read-write access to `/run/docker.sock`.  The crunchy-watch
container runs as the *postgres* user, so adjust the
file permissions of `/run/docker.sock` accordingly.

The *primary-replica* example is required to be run before this example.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Run the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/watch
./run.sh
....

This will start the watch container which tests every few seconds
whether the primary database is running, if not, it will
trigger a failover using `docker exec` on the replica host.

Test it out by stopping the primary:
....
docker stop primary
docker logs watch
....

Look at the watch container logs to see it perform the failover.

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/watch
./run.sh
....

Check out the log of the watch container as follows:
....
${CCP_CLI} log watch
....

Then trigger a failover using this command:
....
${CCP_CLI} delete pod pr-primary
....

Resume watching the watch container's log and verify that it
detects the primary is not reachable and performs a failover
on the replica.

A final test is to see if the old replica is now a fully functioning
primary by inserting some test data into it as follows:
....
psql -h pr-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'create table failtest (id int)'
....

The above command still works because the watch container has
changed the labels of the replica to make it a primary, so the primary
service will still work and route now to the new primary even though
the pod is named replica.

You can view the labels on a pod with this command:
....
${CCP_CLI} describe pod pr-replica | grep Label
....

=== Performing a Backup & Restore

The script assumes you are going to backup the *primary*
container created in the first example, so you need to ensure
that container is running. This example assumes you have configured storage as described
in the link:install.adoc[installation documentation]. Things to point out with this example
include its use of persistent volumes and volume claims to store the backup data files.

A successful backup will perform `pg_basebackup` on the *primary* container and store
the backup in the `$CCP_STORAGE_PATH` volume under a directory named `primary-backups`. Each
backup will be stored in a subdirectory with a timestamp as the name, allowing any number of backups to be kept.

The backup script will do the following:

* Start up a backup container named backup
* Run `pg_basebackup` on the container named *primary*
* Store the backup in the `/tmp/backups/primary-backups` directory
* Exit after the backup

When you are ready to restore from the backup, the restore example runs a PostgreSQL container
using the backup location. Upon initialization, the container will use rsync to copy the backup
data to this new container and then launch PostgreSQL using the original backed-up data.

The restore script will do the following:

* Start up a container named *restore*
* Copy the backup files from the previous backup example into `/pgdata`
* Start up the container using the backup files
* Map the PostgreSQL port of 5432 in the container to your local host port of 12001

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Run the backup with this command:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backup
./run.sh
....

*restore*

When you are ready to restore from the backup created, run the following example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/restore
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backup
./run.sh
....

The Kubernetes Job type executes a pod and then the pod exits.  You can
view the Job status using this command:
....
${CCP-CLI} get job
....

You should find the backup archive in this location:
....
ls $CCP_STORAGE_PATH/primary-backups
....

*restore*

By default, the example will automatically restore from the most recent backup
created by the backup example, located under `$CCP_STORAGE_PATH/$BACKUP_HOST-backups`.
If you want to restore to a specific backup, edit the `restore.json` file and update the
`BACKUP_PATH` setting to specify the backup path you want to restore with. For example:
....
"name": "BACKUP_PATH",
"value": "primary-backups/2018-03-27-14-35-33"
....

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/restore
./run.sh
....

Test the restored database as follows:
....
psql -h restore -U postgres postgres
....

=== pgbackrest

Starting in release 1.3.1, the `pgbackrest` utility has been
added to the crunchy-postgres container.  See the
link:backrest.adoc[pgbackrest Documentation] for details
on how this feature works within the Crunchy Container Suite.

=== pgadmin4-http

This example deploys the pgadmin4 v2 web user interface
for PostgreSQL without TLS.

After running the example, you should be able to browse to http://127.0.0.1:5050
and log into the web application using a user ID of *admin@admin.com*
and password of *password*.

If you are running this example using Kubernetes or
OpenShift, replace *127.0.0.1:5050* with the <NODE_IP>:30000.

To get the node IP, run the following:

....
${CCP_CLI} describe pod pgadmin4-http | grep Node:
....

See the link:http://pgadmin.org[pgadmin4 documentation] for more details.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:

....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To run this example, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgadmin4-http
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start the container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgadmin4-http
./run.sh
....

NOTE: An emptyDir with write access must be mounted to the `/run/httpd` directory in OpenShift.

=== pgadmin4-https

This example deploys the pgadmin4 v2 web user interface
for PostgreSQL with TLS.

After running the example, you should be able to browse to https://127.0.0.1:5050
and log into the web application using a user ID of *admin@admin.com*
and password of *password*.

If you are running this example using Kubernetes or
OpenShift, replace *127.0.0.1:5050* with the <NODE_IP>:30000.

To get the node IP, run the following:

....
${CCP_CLI} describe pod pgadmin4-https | grep Node:
....

See the link:http://pgadmin.org[pgadmin4 documentation] for more details.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:

....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To run this example, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgadmin4-https
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start the container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgadmin4-https
./run.sh
....

NOTE: An emptyDir with write access must be mounted to the `/run/httpd` directory in OpenShift.


=== pgpool

An example is provided that will run a *pgpool* container in conjunction with the
*primary-replica* example provided above.

You can execute both `INSERT` and `SELECT` statements after connecting to pgpool.
The container will direct `INSERT` statements to the primary and `SELECT` statements
will be sent round-robin to both the primary and replica.

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called
*testuser* and a default password of *password*.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Create the container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgpool
./run.sh
....

Enter the following command to connect to the pgpool container that is
mapped to your local port 12003:
....
psql -h localhost -U testuser -p 12003 userdb
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Run the following command to deploy the pgpool service:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgpool
./run.sh
....

The example is configured to allow the *testuser* to connect
to the *userdb* database as follows:
....
psql -h pgpool -U testuser userdb
....

You can view the nodes that pgpool is configured for by running:
....
psql -h pgpool -U testuser userdb -c 'show pool_nodes'
....

=== pgbadger

pgbadger is a PostgreSQL tool that reads the log files from a specified database
in order to produce a HTML report that shows various PostgreSQL statistics and graphs.
This example runs the pgbadger HTTP server against a crunchy-postgres container and
illustrates how to view the generated reports.

The port utilized for this tool is port 14000 for Docker environments and port 10000
for Kubernetes and OpenShift environments.

A requirement to build this container from source is *golang*. On RHEL 7.2, golang
is found in the 'server optional' repository which needs to be enabled in order to install
this dependency.

....
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
....

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called
*testuser* and a default password of *password*.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To run the example:

 * modify the *run-badger.sh* script to refer to the Docker container that you want to run pgbadger against
 * refer to the container's data directory
 * start the container that you are referencing

Then, run the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/badger
./run.sh
....

After execution, the container will run and provide a simple HTTP
command you can browse to view the report.  As you run queries against
the database, you can invoke this URL to generate updated reports:
....
curl http://127.0.0.1:14000/api/badgergenerate
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/badger
./run.sh
....

After execution, the container will run and provide a simple HTTP
command you can browse to view the report.  As you run queries against
the database, you can invoke this URL to generate updated reports:
....
curl http://badger:10000/api/badgergenerate
....

You can view the database container logs using these commands:
....
${CCP_CLI} logs badger -c badger
${CCP_CLI} logs badger -c postgres
....

=== postgres-gis

An example is provided that will run a postgres-gis pod and service in Kubernetes and OpenShift and a container in Docker.

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called
*testuser* and a default password of *password*.

You can view the extensions that postgres-gis has enabled by running the following command and viewing the listed PostGIS packages:
....
psql -h postgres-gis -U testuser userdb -c '\dx'
....

To validate that PostGIS is installed and which version is running, run the command:

....
psql -h postgres-gis -U testuser userdb -c "SELECT postgis_full_version();"
....

You should expect to see output similar to:

....

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Create the container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/postgres-gis
./run.sh
....

Enter the following command to connect to the postgres-gis container that is
mapped to your local port 12000:
....
psql -h localhost -U testuser -p 12000 userdb
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/postgres-gis
./run.sh
....

=== Metrics Collection

You can collect various PostgreSQL metrics from your database
container by running a crunchy-collect container that points
to your database container.

This will start up 4 containers:

 * Collect
 * Grafana
 * PostgreSQL
 * Prometheus

Every 5 seconds by default, Prometheus will scrape the Collect container
for metrics.  These metrics will then be visualized by Grafana.

By default, Prometheus detects which environment its running on (Docker, Kubernetes, or OpenShift Container Platform)
and applies a default configuration.  If this container is running on Kubernetes or OpenShift Container Platform,
it will use the Kubernetes API to discover pods with the label `"crunchy-collect": "true"`.

The collect container *must* have this label to be discovered in these environments.

Discovering pods requires a cluster role service account.  See the
link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/examples/kube/metrics/metrics.json[Kubernetes and OpenShift]
metrics JSON file for more details.

For Docker environments the collect hostname must be specified as an environment
variable.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To start this set of containers, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/metrics
./run.sh
....

You will be able to access the Grafana and Prometheus services from the following
web addresses:

 * Grafana (http://0.0.0.0:3000)
 * Prometheus (http://0.0.0.0:9090)

 The crunchy-postgres container is accessible on port *12015*. 

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/metrics
./run.sh
....

This example runs a pod that includes a database container and
a metrics collection container.

You will be able to access the Grafana and Prometheus services from the following
web addresses:

 * Grafana (http://NODE_IP_ADDRESS:30001)
 * Prometheus (http://NODE_IP_ADDRESS:30002)

You can view the container logs using these command:

....
${CCP_CLI} logs -c grafana metrics
${CCP_CLI} logs -c prometheus metrics
${CCP_CLI} logs -c collect pgsql
${CCP_CLI} logs -c postgres pgsql
....

=== Vacuum

You can perform a PostgreSQL vacuum command by running the crunchy-vacuum
container.  You specify a database to vacuum using environment variables. By default,
it will specify the *primary* example; you will need to start the *primary* container
before running *vacuum*.

The crunchy-vacuum container image exists to allow a DBA a way to run a job either
individually or scheduled to perform a variety of vacuum operations.

This example performs a vacuum on a single table in the primary PostgreSQL
database. The crunchy-vacuum image is executed with the PostgreSQL connection
parameters to the single-primary PostgreSQL container.  The type of vacuum performed is
dictated by the environment variables passed into the job; these are defined with further detail
 link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/containers.adoc#environment-variables-9[here].

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Run the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/vacuum
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/vacuum/
./run.sh
....

Verify the job is completed:
....
${CCP_CLI} get job
....

View the docker log of the vacuum job's pod:
....
docker logs $(docker ps -a | grep crunchy-vacuum | cut -f 1 -d' ')
....

=== Cron Scheduler

The crunchy-dba container implements a cron scheduler. The purpose of the crunchy-dba
container is to offer a way to perform simple DBA tasks that occur on some form of
schedule such as backup jobs or running a vacuum on a single PostgreSQL database container
(such as the *primary* example).

You can either run the crunchy-dba container as a single pod or include the container
within a database pod.

The crunchy-dba container makes use of a Service Account to perform the startup of
scheduled jobs. The Kubernetes Job type is used to execute the scheduled jobs with a Restart
policy of Never.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

The script to schedule vacuum on a regular schedule is executed through the following
commands:

....
# Kubernetes
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba
./run-kube-vac.sh

# OpenShift
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba
./run-ocp-vac.sh
....

To run the script for scheduled backups, run the following in the same directory:
....
# Kubernetes
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba
./run-kube-backup.sh

# OpenShift
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba
./run-ocp-backup.sh
....

Individual parameters for both can be modified within their respective JSON files;
please see link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/containers.adoc[containers.adoc] for a full list of what can be modified.

=== pgbouncer

The pgbouncer utility can be used to provide a connection pool
to PostgreSQL databases.

This example configures pgbouncer to provide connection pooling
for the pg-primary and pg-replica databases.

On Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift, the example will deploy a *primary-replica* equivalent set of pods and related services.

A storage filesystem is required to mount the pgbouncer configuration files which are
then mounted to `/pgconf` in the crunchy-pgbouncer container.

If you mount a `/pgconf` volume, crunchy-postgres will look at that directory
for `postgresql.conf`, `pg_hba.conf`, and `setup.sql`.  If it finds one of them it
will use that file instead of the default files.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

The pgbouncer example is run as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgbouncer
./run.sh
....

To log into the databases from the pgbouncer connection pool
you would enter the following using the default password *password*:
....
psql -h localhost -p 6543 -U testuser pg-primary
psql -h localhost -p 6543 -U testuser pg-replica
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgbouncer
./run.sh
....

To log into the database from the pgbouncer connection pool
you would enter the following using the default password *password*:

....
psql -h pgbouncer -U postgres pg-primary -p 6543
psql -h pgbouncer -U postgres pg-replica -p 6543
....

View the pgbouncer log as follows:

....
${CCP_CLI} log pgbouncer
....

=== Synchronous Replication

This example deploys a PostgreSQL cluster with a primary, a synchronous replica, and
an asynchronous replica. The two replicas share the same service.

Connect to the *primarysync* and *replicasync* databases as follows for both the
Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:
....
psql -h primarysync -U postgres postgres -c 'create table test (id int)'
psql -h primarysync -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into test values (1)'
psql -h primarysync -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from test'
psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from test'
psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from test'
....

This set of queries will show you the IP address of the PostgreSQL replica
container. Note the changing IP address due to the round-robin service proxy
being used for both replicas.  The example queries also show that both
replicas are replicating successfully from the primary.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

To run this example, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/sync
./run.sh
....

You can test the replication status on the primary by using the following command
and the password *password*:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

You should see 2 rows; 1 for the asynchronous replica and 1 for the synchronous replica.  The
`sync_state` column shows values of async or sync.

You can test replication to the replicas by first entering some data on
the primary, and secondly querying the replicas for that data:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12010 -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12011 -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12012 -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/sync
./run.sh
....

=== Statefulsets

This example deploys a statefulset named *statefulset*.  The statefulset
is a new feature in Kubernetes as of version 1.5 and in OpenShift Origin as of
version 3.5. Statefulsets have replaced PetSets going forward.

Please view link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets/[this Kubernetes description]
to better understand what a Statefulset is and how it works.

This example creates 2 PostgreSQL containers to form the set.  At
startup, each container will examine its hostname to determine
if it is the first container within the set of containers.

The first container is determined by the hostname suffix assigned
by Kubernetes to the pod.  This is an ordinal value starting with *0*.

If a container sees that it has an ordinal value of *0*, it will
update the container labels to add a new label of:
....
name=$PG_PRIMARY_HOST
....

In this example, `PG_PRIMARY_HOST` is specified as `statefulset-primary`.

By default, the containers specify a value of `name=statefulset-replica`.

There are 2 services that end user applications will use to
access the PostgreSQL cluster, one service (statefulset-primary) routes to the primary
container and the other (statefulset-replica) to the replica containers.

....
$ ${CCP_CLI} get service
NAME            CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    22h
statefulset           None            <none>        5432/TCP   1h
statefulset-primary    10.97.168.138   <none>        5432/TCP   1h
statefulset-replica   10.97.218.221   <none>        5432/TCP   1h
....

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/statefulset
./run.sh
....

You can access the primary database as follows:
....
psql -h statefulset-primary -U postgres postgres
....

You can access the replica databases as follows:
....
psql -h statefulset-replica -U postgres postgres
....

You can scale the number of containers using this command; this will
essentially create an additional replica database.
....
${CCP_CLI} scale --replicas=3 statefulset statefulset
....

==== Helm

This example resides under the `$CCPROOT/examples/helm` directory. View the README to
run this example using Helm link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/examples/helm/statefulset/README.md[here].

=== pitr - PITR (point in time recovery)

PITR (point-in-time-recovery) is a feature that allows for recreating a database
from backup and log files at a certain point in time. This is done using a write
ahead log (WAL) which is kept in the `pg_wal` directory within `PGDATA`. Changes
made to the database files over time are recorded in these log files, which allows
it to be used for disaster recovery purposes.

When using PITR as a backup method, in order to restore from the last checkpoint in
the event of a database or system failure, it is only necessary to save these log
files plus a full backup. This provides an additional advantage in that it is not
necessary to keep multiple full backups on hand, which consume space and time to create.
This is because point in time recovery allows you to "replay" the log files and recover
your database to any point since the last full backup.

More detailed information about Write Ahead Log (WAL) archiving can be found
link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/continuous-archiving.html[here.]

By default in the crunchy-postgres container, WAL logging is *not* enabled.
To enable WAL logging *outside of this example*, set the following environment
variables when starting the crunchy-postgres container:
....
ARCHIVE_MODE=on
ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT=60
....

These variables set the same name settings within the `postgresql.conf`
file that is used by the database. When set, WAL files generated by the database
will be written out to the `/pgwal` mount point.

A full backup is required to do a PITR.  crunchy-backup currently
performs this role within the example, running a `pg_basebackup` on the database.
This is a requirement for PITR. After a backup is performed, code is added into
crunchy-postgres which will also check to see if you want to do a PITR.

There are three volume mounts used with the PITR example.

* `/recover` - When specified within a crunchy-postgres container, PITR is activated during container startup.
* `/backup` - This is used to find the base backup you want to recover from.
* `/pgwal` - This volume is used to write out new WAL files from the newly restored database container.

Some environment variables used to manipulate the point in time recovery logic:

* The `RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME` environment variable is used to tell the PITR logic what the name of the target is.
* `RECOVERY_TARGET_TIME` is also an optional environment variable that restores using a known time stamp.

If you don't specify either of these environment variables, then the PITR logic will assume you want to
restore using all the WAL files or essentially the last known recovery point.

The `RECOVERY_TARGET_INCLUSIVE` environment variable is also available to
let you control the setting of the `recovery.conf` setting `recovery_target_inclusive`.
If you do not set this environment variable the default is *true*.

Once you recover a database using PITR, it will be in read-only mode. To
make the database resume as a writable database, run the following SQL command:
....
postgres=# select pg_wal_replay_resume();
....

NOTE: If you're running the PITR example for *PostgreSQL versions 9.5 or 9.6*, please note that
starting in PostgreSQL version 10, the `pg_xlog` directory was renamed to `pg_wal`. Additionally, all usages
of the function `pg_xlog_replay_resume` were changed to `pg_wal_replay_resume`.

It takes about 1 minute for the database to become ready for use after initially starting.

WARNING:  WAL segment files are written to the `/tmp` directory. Leaving the example running
for a long time could fill up your `/tmp` directory.

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Create a database container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pitr
./run-pitr.sh
....

Next, we will create a base backup of that database using this:
....
./run-backup-pitr.sh
....

After creating the base backup of the database, WAL segment files are created every 60 seconds
that contain any database changes. These segments are stored in the
`/tmp/pitr/pitr/pg_wal` directory.

Next, create some recovery targets within the database by running
the SQL commands against the *pitr* database as follows:
....
./run-sql.sh
....

This will create recovery targets named `beforechanges`, `afterchanges`, and
`nomorechanges`.  It will create a table, *pitrtest*, between
the `beforechanges` and `afterchanges` targets.  It will also run a SQL
`CHECKPOINT` to flush out the changes to WAL segments. These labels can be
used to mark the points in the recovery process that will be referenced when
creating the restored database.

Next, now that we have a base backup and a set of WAL files containing
our database changes, we can shut down the *pitr* database
to simulate a database failure.  Do this by running the following:
....
docker stop pitr
....

Next, let's edit the restore script to use the base backup files
created in the step above.  You can view the backup path name
under the `/tmp/backups/pitr-backups/` directory. You will see
another directory inside of this path with a name similar to
`2018-03-21-21-03-29`.  Copy and paste that value into the
`run-restore-pitr.sh` script in the `BACKUP` environment variable.

After that, run the script.
....
vi ./run-restore-pitr.sh
./run-restore-pitr.sh
....

The WAL segments are read and applied when restoring from the database
backup.  At this point, you should be able to verify that the
database was restored to the point before creating the test table:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
....

This SQL command should show that the pitrtest table does not exist
at this recovery time. The output should be similar to:
....
ERROR: relation "pitrtest" does not exist
....

PostgreSQL allows you to pause the recovery process if the target name
or time is specified.  This pause would allow a DBA a chance to review
the recovery time/name and see if this is what they want or expect.  If so,
the DBA can run the following command to resume and complete the recovery:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'select pg_wal_replay_resume()'
....

Until you run the statement above, the database will be left in read-only
mode.

Next, run the script to restore the database
to the `afterchanges` restore point. Update the `RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME` to `afterchanges`:
....
vi ./run-restore-pitr.sh
./run-restore-pitr.sh
....

After this restore, you should be able to see the test table:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'select pg_wal_replay_resume()'
....

Lastly, start a recovery using all of the WAL files. This will get the
restored database as current as possible. To do so, edit the script
to remove the `RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME` environment setting completely:
....
./run-restore-pitr.sh
sleep 30
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
....

At this point, you should be able to create new data in the restored database
and the test table should be present.  When you recover the entire
WAL history, resuming the recovery is not necessary to enable writes.

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start by running the example database container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pitr
./run-pitr.sh
....

This step will create a database container, *pitr*.  This
container is configured to continuously write WAL segment files
to a mounted volume (`/pgwal`).

After you start the database, you will create a base backup
using this command:
....
./run-backup-pitr.sh
....

This will create a backup and write the backup files to a persistent
volume (`/pgbackup`).

Next, create some recovery targets within the database by running
the SQL commands against the *pitr* database as follows:
....
./run-sql.sh
....

This will create recovery targets named `beforechanges`, `afterchanges`, and
`nomorechanges`.  It will create a table, *pitrtest*, between
the `beforechanges` and `afterchanges` targets.  It will also run a SQL
`CHECKPOINT` to flush out the changes to WAL segments.

Next, now that we have a base backup and a set of WAL files containing
our database changes, we can shut down the *pitr* database
to simulate a database failure.  Do this by running the following:
....
${CCP_CLI} delete pod pitr
....

Next, we will create 3 different restored database containers based
upon the base backup and the saved WAL files.

First, we restore prior to the `beforechanges` recovery target.  This
recovery point is *before* the *pitrtest* table is created.

Edit the `restore-pitr.json` file, and edit the environment
variable to indicate we want to use the `beforechanges` recovery
point:
....
}, {
"name": "RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME",
"value": "beforechanges"
}, {
....

Then run the following to create the restored database container:
....
./run-restore-pitr.sh
....

After the database has restored, you should be able to perform
a test to see if the recovery worked as expected:
....
psql -h restore-pitr -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
psql -h restore-pitr -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
....

The output of these commands should show that the *pitrtest* table is not
present.  It should also show that you can not create a new table
because the database is paused in read-only mode.

To make the database resume as a writable database, run the following
SQL command:
....
select pg_wal_replay_resume();
....

It should then be possible to write to the database:
....
psql -h restore-pitr -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
....

You can also test that if `afterchanges` is specified, that the
*pitrtest* table is present but that the database is still in recovery
mode.

Lastly, you can test a full recovery using *all* of the WAL files, if
you remove the `RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME` environment variable completely.

The storage portions of this example can all be found under `$CCP_STORAGE_PATH`.

=== pg_audit

This example provides an example of enabling pg_audit output.
As of release 1.3, pg_audit is included in the crunchy-postgres
container and is added to the PostgreSQL shared library list in
`postgresql.conf`.

Given the numerous ways pg_audit can be configured, the exact
pg_audit configuration is left to the user to define.  pg_audit
allows you to configure auditing rules either in `postgresql.conf`
or within your SQL script.

For this test, we place pg_audit statements within a SQL script
and verify that auditing is enabled and working.  If you choose
to configure pg_audit via a `postgresql.conf` file, then you will
need to define your own custom file and mount it to override the
default `postgresql.conf` file.

==== Docker

Run the following to create a database container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgaudit
./run.sh
....

This starts an instance of the pg_audit container (running crunchy-postgres)
on port 12005 on localhost. The test script is then automatically executed.

This test executes a SQL file which contains pg_audit configuration
statements as well as executes some basic SQL commands.  These
SQL commands will cause pg_audit to create log messages in
the `pg_log` log file created by the database container.

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgaudit
./run.sh
....

The script will create the pg_audit pod (running the crunchy-postgres container)
on the Kubernetes instance and then execute a SQL file which
contains pg_audit configuration statements as well as some
basic SQL commands.  These SQL commands will cause pg_audit to create
log messages in the `pg_log` file created by the database container.

=== Docker Swarm


This example shows how to run a primary and replica database
container on a Docker Swarm (v.1.12) cluster.

First, set up a cluster. The Kubernetes libvirt coreos cluster
example works well; see link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/libvirt-coreos/[coreos-libvirt-cluster.]

Next, on each node, create the Swarm using these
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/[Swarm Install instructions.]

Include this command on the manager node:
....
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.10.1
....

Then this command on all the worker nodes:
....
 docker swarm join \
     --token SWMTKN-1-65cn5wa1qv76l8l45uvlsbprogyhlprjpn27p1qxjwqmncn37o-015egopg4jhtbmlu04faon82u \
         192.168.10.1.37
....

Before creating Swarm services, it is necessary
to define an overlay network to be used by the services you will
create. This can be done as follows:
....
docker network create --driver overlay crunchynet
....

We want to have the primary database always placed on
a specific node. This is accomplished using node constraints
as follows:
....
docker node inspect kubernetes-node-1 | grep ID
docker node update --label-add type=primary 18yrb7m650umx738rtevojpqy
....

In the above example, the `kubernetes-node-1` node with ID
`18yrb7m650umx738rtevojpqy` has a user defined label of *primary* added to it.
The primary service specifies *primary* as a constraint when created; this
tells Swarm to place the service on that specific node.  The replica specifies
a constraint of `node.labels.type != primary` to have the replica
always placed on a node that is not hosting the primary service.

==== Docker

After you set up the Swarm cluster, you can then run this example as follows on the *Swarm Manager Node*:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/swarm-service
./run.sh
....

You can then find the nodes that are running the primary and replica containers
by:
....
docker service ps primary
docker service ps replica
....

You can also scale up the number of *replica* containers.
....
docker service scale replica=2
docker service ls
....

Verify you have two replicas within PostgreSQL by viewing the `pg_stat_replication` table.
The password is *password* by default when logged into the `kubernetes-node-1` host:
....
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q) psql -U postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication' postgres
....

You should see a row for each replica along with its replication status.

=== pg_upgrade
Starting in release 1.3.1, the upgrade container will let
you perform a pg_upgrade either from a PostgreSQL version 9.5 database to
9.6 or from 9.6 to 10.

This example assumes you have run *primary* using a PG 9.5 or 9.6 image
such as `centos7-9.5.12-1.8.2` prior to running this upgrade.

Prior to starting this example, shut down the *primary* database
using the `examples/kube/primary/cleanup.sh` script.

Prior to running this example, make sure your `CCP_IMAGE_TAG`
environment variable is using the next major version of PostgreSQL that you
want to upgrade to. For example, if you're upgrading from 9.5 to 9.6, make
sure the variable references a PG 9.6 image such as `centos7-9.6.8-1.8.2`.

This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:

 * a Kubernetes Job running the *crunchy-upgrade* container
 * a new data directory name *upgrade* found in the *pgnewdata*
 PVC

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Start the upgrade as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/upgrade
./run.sh
....

If successful, the Job will end with a **successful** status. Verify
the results of the Job by examining the Job's pod log:
....
${CCP_CLI} get pod -a -l job-name=upgrade-job
${CCP_CLI} logs -l job-name=upgrade-job
....

You can verify the upgraded database by running the
`examples/kube/primary-upgrade` example. This example will mount the newly created
and upgraded database files. Database tables and data that were in the *primary*
test database should be found in the *primary-upgrade* database.

=== Performing a pg_dump

The script assumes you are going to backup the *primary*
container created in the first example, so you need to ensure
that container is running. This example assumes you have configured a storage filesystem as described
in the link:install.adoc[installation documentation]. Things to point out with this example
include its use of persistent volumes and volume claims to store the backup data files.

A successful backup will perform pg_dump/pg_dumpall on the primary and store
the resulting files in the mounted volume under a directory named using the database host
name plus -dumps as a sub-directory, then followed by a unique backup directory based upon a
date and timestamp - allowing any number of backups to be kept.

The dump script will do the following:

 * Start up a backup container named pgdump
 * Run pg_dump/pg_dumpall on the container named primary
 * Store the backup in the PV in a path named with a date and timestamp
 * Exit after the backup

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Run the backup with this command:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgdump
./run.sh
....

Make note of the container ID from the output of the run script in order to check the Docker logs of the container.
....
docker logs pgdump 2>&1 | grep "output"
....

That will return the location where the pg_dump/pg_dumpall file(s) were written.  E.g.:
....
PGDUMP_ALL output file has been written to: /pgdata/primary-dumps/2018-02-14-05-00-23/pgdumpall.sql
....

Make note of the timestamp above and run a find to get the fully-qualified filesystem path where the file was written.  E.g.:
....
sudo find / -name 2018-02-14-05-00-23
....

That will return the fully-qualified path, where the file can be accessed or copied to your local filesystem.  E.g.:
....
/var/lib/docker/volumes/pgdump-volume/_data/primary-dumps/2018-02-14-05-00-23
....

Copy the file (path returned above + the filename) to your local filesystem for use or for running with the pg_restore container:
....
sudo cp -p /var/lib/docker/volumes/pgdump-volume/_data/primary-dumps/2018-02-14-05-00-23/pgdumpall.sql /tmp
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgdump
./run.sh
....

The Kubernetes Job type executes a pod and then the pod exits.  You can
view the Job status using this command:
....
${CCP_CLI} get job
....

The `pgdump.json` file within that directory specifies options that control the behavior of the pgdump job.
Examples of this include whether to run pg_dump vs pg_dumpall, whether to include verbose output, if database objects should be
cleanly dropped before being recreated, and so on.

=== Performing a pg_restore

The script assumes you are going to restore to the *primary*
container created in the first example, so you need to ensure
that container is running. This example assumes you have configured storage as described
in the link:install.adoc[installation documentation]. Things to point out with this example
include its use of persistent volumes and volume claims to store the backup data files.

Successful use of the crunchy-pgrestore container will run a job to restore files generated by
pg_dump/pg_dumpall to a container via psql/pg_restore; then container will terminate successfully
and signal job completion.

The restore script will do the following:

 * Mount a PV/PVC as named in the JSON file
 * Run psql/pg_restore on the container named primary (or as specified otherwise in the JSON file)
 * Exit after the backup

To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:
....
./cleanup.sh
....

==== Docker

Run the restore with this command:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgrestore
./run.sh
....

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

By default, the example will automatically restore from the most recent backup
created by the backup example, located under `$CCP_STORAGE_PATH/$PGDUMP_HOST-dumps`.
If you want to restore to a specific backup, edit the `pgrestore.json` file and update the
`PGRESTORE_VOLUMEPATH` setting to specify the backup path you want to restore with. For example:
....
"name":"PGRESTORE_VOLUMEPATH",
"value":"/pgdata/primary-dumps/2018-03-27-14-35-33"
....

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgrestore
./run.sh
....

The Kubernetes Job type executes a pod and then the pod exits.  You can
view the Job status using this command:

....
${CCP_CLI} get job
....

The `pgrestore.json` file within that directory specifies options that control the behavior of the pgrestore job.
Examples of this include whether to restore via psql vs pg_restore (dependent on the `PGRESTORE_FORMAT` variable), whether to include verbose output,
if database objects should be cleanly dropped before being recreated, and so on.
