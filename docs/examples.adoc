== Container Examples

=== Running a Single Database


==== Docker

This example starts a single PostgreSQL container and service, the most simple
of examples.

To create the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/basic
./run.sh
....

This script will do the following:

 * Create a persistent volume claim
 * Create a container named *basic*
 * Initialize the database using the predefined environment variables
 * Map the PostgreSQL port 5432 within the container to the localhost port 12000

Start the container by running the following.
....
docker start basic
....

View the status of this container by running:
....
docker ps | grep basic
....

This will display the container that was just created and started, and should state that it is up in addition to the IP address and port it resides on.

If you need to diagnose the container, you can do so by viewing the logs.
....
docker logs basic
....

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called *testuser* and a default password of *password*. Connect from your local host as follows:
....
psql -h localhost -p 12000 -U testuser -W userdb
....

To shut down the instance, run the following:
....
docker stop basic
....


==== Kubernetes

This example starts a single PostgreSQL container and service, the most simple
of examples.

To create the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/basic
./run.sh
....

This script will do the following:

 * Create a persistent volume claim
 * Create a pod named *basic*
 * Initialize the database using the predefined environment variables
 * Map the PostgreSQL port 5432 within the container to the localhost port 12000

Verify that everything is running successfully by running the following:
....
kubectl get pod basic
kubectl get service basic
kubectl logs basic
....

After the database starts up you can connect to it as follows:
....
psql -h basic -U postgres postgres
....


==== OpenShift

This example starts a single PostgreSQL container and service, the most simple
of examples.

To create the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/basic
./run.sh
....

This script will do the following:

 * Create a persistent volume claim
 * Create a pod named *basic*
 * Initialize the database using the predefined environment variables
 * Map the PostgreSQL port 5432 within the container to the localhost port 12000

You can see what passwords were generated by running this command:
....
oc describe pod basic | grep PG
....

Run the following command to test the database, entering
the value of PG_PASSWORD from above for the password when prompted:
....
psql -h basic.openshift.svc.cluster.local -U testuser userdb
....

=== Creating a Primary / Replica Database Cluster


==== Docker

Create this example by running the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary-replica
./run.sh
....

This script will do the following:

 * Create a docker volume using the local driver for the primary
 * Create a docker volume using the local driver for the replica
 * Create a container named *primary* binding to port 12007
 * Create a container named *replica* binding to port 12008
 * Initialize the database using the predefined environment variables
 * Map the PostgreSQL port 5432 within the container to the localhost port 12000

Start the containers by running the following.
....
docker start primary replica
....

View the status of these containers by running:
....
docker ps | grep 'primary\|replica'
....

This will display the container that was just created and started, and should state that it is up in addition to the IP address and port it resides on.

If you need to diagnose the container, you can do so by viewing the logs.
....
docker logs primary
docker logs replica
....

The container creates a default database called *userdb*, a default user called *testuser* and a default password of *password*. Connect from your local host as follows:
....
psql -h localhost -p 12007 -U testuser -W userdb
psql -h localhost -p 12008 -U testuser -W userdb
....

To shut down the instance, run the following:
....
docker stop primary replica
....

==== Docker-Compose

This is a *docker-compose* example of deploying primary
and read replicas using the crunchy-postgres image from DockerHub.

To install docker-compose, please follow the instructions located
in the link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[official Docker documentation].

To deploy this example, run the following commands:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/compose/primary-replica
docker-compose up
....

Optionally, to deploy more than one replica, run the following:

....
docker-compose up --scale db-replica=3
....

To psql into the created database containers, first identify the ports exposed
on the containers:

....
docker ps
....

Next, using psql, connect to the service:

....
psql -d userdb -h 0.0.0.0 -p <CONTAINER_PORT> -U testuser
....

*Note:* See *PG_PASSWORD* in *docker-compose.yml* for the user password.

To tear down the example, run the following:

....
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm
....

==== Kubernetes

This example starts a primary pod, primary service, replica pod, and replica
service.  The replica is a replica of the primary.  This example uses
emptyDir volumes for persistence.  This example does not allow
you to scale up the replicas.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica
./run.sh
....

It takes about a minute for the replica to begin replicating with the
primary.  To test out replication, see if replication is underway
with this command:
....
psql -h ms-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

If you see a line returned from that query it means the primary is replicating
to the replica.  Try creating some data on the primary:

....
psql -h ms-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h ms-primary -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'
....

Then verify that the data is replicated to the replica:
....
psql -h ms-replica -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
....


==== OpenShift

Run the following command to deploy a primary and replica database cluster:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/primary-replica
./run.sh
....

Similarly to the previous example on *basic*, you can view the generated
passwords by running this command:

....
oc describe pod ms-primary | grep PG
....

You can then connect to the database instance as follows using the password
shown with the previous command:

....
psql -h ms-primary -U testuser -W userdb
....

=== Primary / Scaling Replica


==== Kubernetes

This example starts a primary pod, primary service, replica pod, and replica
service.  The replica is a replica of the primary.  This example uses
emptyDir volumes for persistence.  This example runs the replicas in a
Deployment.  A deployment controller lets you scale up the replicas and
create an initial replica set.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica-dc
./run.sh
....

You can insert data in the primary and make sure it replicates to
the replicas using the commands from Example 2 above.  Replace
*primary* with the *primary-dc* name and *replica* with *replica-dc*.

This example creates 2 replicas when it initially starts.  To scale
up the number of replicas, run this command:
....
kubectl get deployment
kubectl scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=3 deployment/replica-dc
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get pod
....

You can verify that you now have 3 replicas by running this query
on the primary:
....
psql -h primary-dc -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....


==== OpenShift

This example is similar to the previous examples but
builds a primary pod, and a single replica that can be scaled up
using a replication controller. The primary is implemented as
a single pod since it can not be scaled like read-only replicas.

Running the example:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/primary-replica-dc
./run.sh
....

Connect to the PostgreSQL instances with the following:

....
psql -h primary-dc.pgproject.svc.cluster.local -U testuser userdb
psql -h replica-dc.pgproject.svc.cluster.local -U testuser userdb
....

Here is an example of increasing or scaling up the PostgreSQL 'replica' pods to 2:

....
oc scale rc replica-dc-1 --replicas=2
....

To check the *primary* default password, enter the following command and look for
the *PG_PRIMARY_USER* and *PG_MASTER_PASSWORD* variables:

....
oc describe pod primary-dc | grep PG
....

Enter the following commands to verify the PostgreSQL replication is working, using
the password for primary found with the previous command.

....
psql -c 'table pg_stat_replication' -h primary-dc.pgproject.svc.cluster.local -U master postgres
psql -h replica-dc.pgproject.svc.cluster.local -U master postgres
....

You can see that the replica service is load balancing between
multiple replicas by running a command as follows, run the command
multiple times and the IP address should alternate between
the replicas:

....
psql -h replica-dc -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr()'
....

=== Primary / Replica Deployment with PVC


==== OpenShift

This example uses a PVC based volume for the primary and the replicas.  In
some scenarios, customers might want to have all the PostgreSQL
instances using NFS volumes for persistence.

To run the example, follow these steps:

As the project user, create the primary / replica deployment:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/primary-replica-rc-pvc
./run.sh
....

Note:  The *primary-replica.json* file creates the primary and replica deployment,
creating pods and services where the replica is controlled by a Replication Controller,
allowing you to scale up the replicas.

If you examine your NFS directory, you will see PostgreSQL data directories
created and used by your primary and replica pods.

Next, add some test data to the primary:
....
psql -c 'create table testtable (id int)' -U master -h m-s-rc-pvc-primary postgres
psql -c 'insert into testtable values (123)' -U master -h m-s-rc-pvc-primary postgres
....

Next, add a new replica:
....
oc scale rc m-s-rc-pvc-replica-1 --replicas=2
....

At this point, you should see the new NFS directory created by the new
replica pod, and you should also be able to test that replication is
working on the new replica:
....
psql -c 'table testtable' -U master -h m-s-rc-pvc-replica postgres
....

=== Master / Replica Deployment


==== Kubernetes

Starting in release 1.2.8, the PostgreSQL container can accept
an environment variable named PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE.  If set,
the /pgdata/subdir path will use a path subdir name of your
choosing instead of the default which is the hostname of the container.

This example shows how a Deployment of a PostgreSQL master is
supported. A pod is a deployment that uses a hostname generated by
Kubernetes; because of this, a new hostname will be defined upon
restart of the master pod.

For finding the /pgdata that pertains to the pod, you will need
to specify a /pgdata/subdir name that never changes. This requirement is
handled by the PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE environment variable.

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-deployment
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Kube environment:

 * master-dc service, uses a PVC to persist PostgreSQL data
 * replica-dc service, uses emptyDir persistence
 * master-dc Deployment of replica count 1 for the master
   PostgreSQL database pod
 * replica-dc Deployment of replica count 1 for the replica
 * replica2-dc Deployment of replica count 1 for the 2nd replica
 * ConfigMap to hold a custom postgresql.conf, setup.sql, and
   pg_hba.conf files
 * Secrets for the master user, superuser, and normal user to
   hold the passwords
 * Volume mount for /pgbackrest and /pgwal

The persisted data for the PostgreSQL master is found under /pgdata/master-dc.
If you delete the master pod, the Deployment will create another
pod for the master, and will be able to start up immediately since
we are using the same /pgdata/master-dc data directory.


==== OpenShift

Starting in release 1.2.8, the PostgreSQL container can accept
an environment variable named PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE.  If set,
the /pgdata/subdir path will use a path subdir name of your
choosing instead of the default which is the hostname of the container.

This example shows how a Deployment of a PostgreSQL master is
supported. A pod is a deployment that uses a hostname generated by
Kubernetes; because of this, a new hostname will be defined upon
restart of the master pod.

For finding the /pgdata that pertains to the pod, you will need
to specify a /pgdata/subdir name that never changes. This requirement is
handled by the PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE environment variable.

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/primary-deployment
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your OpenShift environment:

 * master-dc service, uses a PVC to persist PostgreSQL data
 * replica-dc service, uses emptyDir persistence
 * master-dc Deployment of replica count 1 for the master
   PostgreSQL database pod
 * replica-dc Deployment of replica count 1 for the replica
 * replica2-dc Deployment of replica count 1 for the 2nd replica
 * ConfigMap to hold a custom postgresql.conf, setup.sql, and
   pg_hba.conf files
 * Secrets for the master user, superuser, and normal user to
   hold the passwords
 * Volume mount for /pgbackrest and /pgwal

The persisted data for the PostgreSQL master is found under /pgdata/master-dc.
If you delete the master pod, the Deployment will create another
pod for the master, and will be able to start up immediately since
we are using the same /pgdata/master-dc data directory.

=== Master using PVC


==== OpenShift

This example will create a single PostgreSQL master pod that is using
a PVC based volume to store the PostgreSQL data files.

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/master-pvc
./run.sh
....

=== Performing a Backup


==== Docker

In order to run this backup script, you first need to edit
run.sh to specify your host IP address you are running
on.  The script assumes you are going to backup the *basic*
container created in the first example, so you need to ensure
that container is running.

Run the backup with this command:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backup
./run.sh
....

This script will do the following:

 * Start up a backup container named basicbackup
 * Run pg_basebackup on the container named master
 * Store the backup in /tmp/backups/master directory
 * Exit after the backup


==== Kubernetes

This example performs a database backup on the basic database.
The backup is stored in the /nfsfileshare backup path which is also
a dependency.  See the installation docs on how to set up the NFS
server on this host.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/basic
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backup-job
./run.sh
....

Things to point out with this example include its use of persistent
volumes and volume claims to store the backup data files to
an NFS server.

You can view the persistent volume information as follows:
....
kubectl get pvc
kubectl get pv
....

The Kube Job type executes a pod and then the pod exits.  You can
view the Job status using this command:
....
kubectl get job
....

While the backup pod is running, you can view the pod as follows:
....
kubectl get pod
....

You should find the backup archive in this location:
....
ls /nfsfileshare/basic
....

*Tip*

You can view the backup pod log using the *docker logs* command
on the exited container. Use *docker ps -a | grep backup* to
locate the container.


==== OpenShift

This example assumes you have configured NFS as described
in the link:install.adoc[installation documentation].

You can perform a database backup by executing the following
step:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/basic
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/backup-job
./run.sh
....

A successful backup will perform pg_basebackup on the pg-master and store
the backup in the NFS mounted volume under a directory named pg-master, each
backup will be stored in a subdirectory with a timestamp as the name.  This
allows any number of backups to be kept.

The *examples/openshift/crunchy-pv-backup.json* specifies a *persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy* of *Retain* to tell OpenShift
that we want to keep the volume contents after the removal of the PV.

=== Restoring a Backup


==== Docker

In order to run this backup script, you first need to edit
run.sh to specify your host IP address you are running
on.

Run the backup with this command:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary-replica
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/restore
./run.sh
....

This script will do the following:

 * start up a container named master-restore
 * copy the backup files from the previous backup example into /pgdata
 * start up the container using the backup files
 * maps the PostgreSQL port of 5432 in the container to your local host port of 12001 as to not conflict with the master running in the previous example.


==== Kubernetes

This example assumes you have run the backup-job example prior
to this example!

You will need to find a backup you want to
use for running this example, you will need the timestamped directory
path under /nfsfileshare/basic/.  Edit the master-restore.json
file and update the BACKUP_PATH setting to specify the
NFS backup path you want to restore with, example:
....
"name": "BACKUP_PATH",
"value": "basic/2016-05-27-14-35-33"
....

This example runs a postgres container passing in the backup location.
The startup of the container will use rsync to copy the backup data
to this new container, and then launch postgres which will use the
backup data to startup with.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/master-restore
./run.sh
....

Test the restored database as follows:
....
psql -h restored-master -U postgres postgres
....


==== OpenShift

This is an example of restoring a database pod using
an existing backup archive located on an NFS volume.

First, locate the database backup you want to restore, for example:
....
/nfsfileshare/pg-master/2016-01-29:22:34:20
....

Then create the pod:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/master-restore
./run.sh
....

When the database pod starts, it will copy the backup files
to the database directory inside the pod and start up postgres as
usual.

The restore only takes place if:

 * the /pgdata directory is empty
 * the /backups directory contains a valid postgresql.conf file

=== Manual Failover


==== OpenShift

An example of performing a database failover is described
in the following steps:

* create a primary and replica replication
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/primary-replica-dc
./run.sh
....
* scale up the number of replicas to 2
....
oc scale rc replica-dc-1 --replicas=2
....
* delete the primary pod
....
oc delete pod primary-dc
....
* exec into a replica and create a trigger file to being
  the recovery process, effectively turning the replica into a primary
....
oc exec -it replica-dc-1-lt5a5
touch /tmp/pg-failover-trigger
....
* change the label on the replica to primary-dc instead of replica-dc
....
oc edit pod/replica-dc-1-lt5a5
original line: labels/name: replica-dc
updated line: labels/name: primary-dc
....

* or alternatively:

....
oc label --overwrite=true pod replica-dc-1-lt5a5 name=primary-dc
....

You can test the failover by creating some data on the primary
and then test to see if the replicas have the replicated data.

....
psql -c 'create table foo (id int)' -U master -h primary-dc postgres
psql -c 'table foo' -U master -h replica-dc postgres
....

After a failover, you would most likely want to create a database
backup and be prepared to recreate your cluster from that backup.

=== pgbackrest


==== Kubernetes

Starting in release 1.2.5, the pgbackrest utility has been
added to the crunchy-postgres container.  See the
link:backrest.adoc[pgbackrest Documentation] for details
on how this feature works within the container suite.

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Kube environment:

 * A configMap named backrestconf which contains the pgbackrest.conf file
 * master-backrest pod with pgbackrest archive enabled. An initial stanza db will be created on initialization
 * master-backrest service

The crunchy-pvc will be used for /pgdata, and crunchy-pvc2 for the /backrestrepo. Examine the /backrestrepo location to view the archive directory and ensure WAL archiving is working. See link:backrest.adoc[pgbackrest Documentation] for steps to backup and restore using pgbackrest.


==== OpenShift

This example shows how to enable pgbackrest as the archiver
within the crunchy-postgres container.
See the link:backrest.adoc[pgbackrest documentation] for details and background.

Start by running the example database container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/backrest
./run.sh
....

This will create the following:

 * PV/PVC for /pgconf and /backrestrepo volumes
 * master database pod
 * master service

The run.sh script copies the pgbackrest.conf configuration file
to /nfsfileshare/pgconf which is our NFS file path.

The archive files are written to the NFS path of /nfsfileshare/backrestrepo.

The presence of /pgconf/pgbackrest.conf is what is used to
determine whether pgbackrest will be used as the archive command or not.
You will need to specify the ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT environment variable
as well to use this.

After you run the example, you should see archive files
being written to the /backrestrepo volume (/nfsfileshare/backrestrepo).

You can create a backup using backrest using this command within
the container:
....
pgbackrest --stanza=db backup --db-path=/pgdata/master-backrest/ --log-path=/tmp --repo-path=/backrestrepo -conf=/pgconf/pgbackrest.conf
....

=== Restoring pgbackrest


==== Kubernetes & OpenShift

This assumes you have run the pgbackrest example above. There are two options to choose from when performing a restore, DELTA and FULL. A FULL is the default; a DELTA will only occur if the environment variable DELTA is specified in the restore-job spec. Consult the pgbackrest user guide to determine which is best suited to run.

Steps for FULL restore

 * Delete the master-backrest pod, if still running
 * Empty the PGDATA directory (remove all files)
 * Navigate to the backrest-restore examples directory. Execute the full-restore.sh script.
 * Check the restore logs (db-restore.log) in the /backrestrepo mountpoint for success. You can also view the logs of the completed job pod with kubectl get pod -a
 * Re-create the master-backrest pod in the backrest examples directory. The database will recover.

Steps for DELTA restore

 * Delete the master-backrest pod, if still running
 * rm postmaster.pid from PGDATA.
 * Navigate to the backrest-restore examples directory. Execute the delta-restore.sh script.
 * Check the restore logs (db-restore.log) in the /backrestrepo mountpoint for success. You can also view the logs of the completed job pod with kubectl get pod -a
 * Re-create the master-backrest pod in the backrest examples directory. The database will recover only files that have changed from the last backup.

=== pgadmin4

==== Docker

This example, $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgadmin4, provides a
container that runs the pgadmin4 web application.

To run this example, run the following:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgadmin4
./run.sh
....

You should now be able to browse to http://YOURLOCALIP:5050
and log into the web application using a user ID of *admin@admin.org*
and password of *password*.  Replace YOURLOCALIP with whatever
your local IP address happens to be.

==== Kubernetes

This example deploys the pgadmin4 (beta4) web user interface
for PostgreSQL.

Start the container as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgadmin4
./run.sh
....

This will start a container and service for pgadmin4.  You can browse
the user interface at http://pgadmin4.default.svc.cluster.local:5050

See the pgadmin4 documentation for more details at http://pgadmin.org

The example uses pgadmin4 configuration files which are mounted
at an NFS mount point, this NFS data directory is mounted into
the container and used by the pgadmin4 application to persist
metadata.


==== OpenShift

This example, examples/openshift/pgadmin4, provides a
container that runs the pgadmin4 web application.

To run this example, run the following:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/pgadmin4
./run.sh
....

This script creates the *pgadmin4* pod and service, it will
expose port 5050.

You should now be able to browse to http://pgadmin4.openshift.svc.cluster.local:5050
and log into the web application using a user ID of *admin@admin.org*
and password of *password*.  Replace YOURLOCALIP with whatever
your local IP address happens to be.

=== Proxy

==== Docker

A *crunchy-proxy* example is provided that will run a container that
is configured to be used with the master and replica example provided
in the *primary-replica* example.

You can create the proxy by running:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary-replica
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/crunchy-proxy
./run.sh
....

This proxy will listen on localhost:12432.  You can access the
*primary-replica* cluster by:
....
psql -h localhost -p 12432 -U postgres postgres
....

See this link for details on the *crunchy-proxy*:
https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-proxy

You might consider *crunchy-proxy* over pgpool and pgbouncer if
you need load-balancing and smart SQL routing.

==== Kubernetes

This example runs a crunchy-proxy pod that creates a special purpose
proxy to a postgres cluster (master and replica).

*crunchy-proxy* offers a high performance alternative to
pgbouncer and pgpool.

The proxy example copies a configuration file to the PV_PATH
and starts up the *crunchy-proxy* within a Deployment.

If you run the example in minikube, you will need to manually
copy the crunchy-proxy-config.json file to a file on
the minikube named */data/config.json*.

The proxy reads the configuration file from a */config* volume
mount and begins execution.

Start by running the proxy container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/crunchy-proxy
./run.sh
....

The proxy will listen on port 5432 as specified in the
configuration file.  The example creates a Service named
*crunchy-proxy* that you can use to access the configured
PostgreSQL backend containers from the *primary-replica* example.

See the following link for more information on the *crunchy-proxy*:

https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-proxy

Test the proxy by running psql commands via the proxy connection:
....
psql -h crunchy-proxy -U postgres postgres
....

SQL "reads" will be sent to the PostgreSQL replica database if your
SQL includes the *crunchy-proxy* read annotation.  SQL statements
that do not include the read annotation will be sent to the master
database container within the PostgreSQL cluster.

==== OpenShift

This example shows how to use the *crunchy-proxy* to
act as a smart proxy to a PostgreSQL cluster.  The example
depends upon the *primary-replica* example being run prior.

*crunchy-proxy* offers a high performance alternative to
pgbouncer and pgpool.

The proxy example copies a configuration file to the PV_PATH
and starts up the *crunchy-proxy* within a Deployment.

The proxy reads the configuration file from a */config* volume
mount and begins execution.

Start by running the proxy container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/primary-replica
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/crunchy-proxy
./run.sh
....

The proxy will listen on port 5432 as specified in the
configuration file.  The example creates a Service named
*crunchy-proxy* that you can use to access the configured
PostgreSQL backend containers from the *primary-replica* example.

See the following link for more information on the *crunchy-proxy*:

https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-proxy

Test the proxy by running psql commands via the proxy connection:
....
psql -h crunchy-proxy -U postgres postgres
....

SQL "reads" will be sent to the PostgreSQL replica database if your
SQL includes the *crunchy-proxy* read annotation.  SQL statements
that do not include the read annotation will be sent to the master
database container within the PostgreSQL cluster.

=== Openshift Customized Configuration

==== OpenShift

This example shows how you can use your own customized version of setup.sql
when creating a postgres database container.

If you mount a /pgconf volume, crunchy-postgres will look at that directory
for postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, and setup.sql.  If it finds one of them it
will use that file instead of the default files.  Currently, if you specify a postgresql.conf
file, you also need to specify a pg_hba.conf file.

The example shows how a custom setup.sql file can be used.
Run it as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/custom-config
./run.sh
....

This will start a database container that will use an NFS mounted /pgconf
directory that will container the custom setup.sql file found in the example
directory.

=== Openshift Customized Configuration with Synchronous Replica

==== OpenShift

This example shows how you can use your own customized version of postgresql.conf
and pg_hba.conf to override the default configuration.  It also specifies
a synchronous replica in the postgresql.conf and starts it up upon creation.

If you mount a /pgconf volume, crunchy-postgres will look at that directory
for postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, and setup.sql.  If it finds one of them it
will use that file instead of the default files.  Currently, if you specify a postgresql.conf
file, you also need to specify a pg_hba.conf file.

Run it as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/custom-config-sync
./run.sh
....

This will start a *csmaster* container that will use the custom
config files when the database is running.  It will also create
a synchronous replica named *cssyncreplica*. This replica is then
connected to the master via streaming replication.

=== Openshift Configmap Database Credentials

==== OpenShift

This example shows how to use a configmap to store the
postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf files to be used when
overriding the default configuration within the container.

Start by running the database container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/configmap
./run.sh
....

The files, pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf, in the
example directory are used to create a configmap object
within OpenShift.  Within the run.sh script, the configmap
is created, and notice within the configmap.json file
how the /pgconf mount is related to the configmap.

=== pgpool

==== Docker

A pgpool example is provided that will run a pgpool container that
is configured to be used with the master and replica example provided
in the *primary-replica* example. After running
those commands to create a master and replica, you can
create a pgpool container by running the following example command:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary-replica
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgpool
./run.sh
....

Enter the following command to connect to the pgpool that is
mapped to your local port 12003:
....
psql -h localhost -U testuser -p 12003 userdb
....

You will enter the password of *password* when prompted.  At this point
you can execute both INSERT and SELECT statements on the pgpool connection.
Pgpool will direct INSERT statements to the master and SELECT statements
will be sent round-robin to both master and replica.

==== Kubernetes

This example runs a pgpool pod that creates a special purpose
proxy to a PostgreSQL cluster that contains a master and a replica
database.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/primary-replica
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgpool
./run.sh
....

The example is configured to allow the *testuser* to connect
to the *userdb* database as follows:
....
psql -h pgpool -U testuser userdb
....

==== OpenShift

This example runs a pgpool pod that creates a special purpose
proxy to a PostgreSQL cluster that contains a master and a replica
database.

Edit the pgpool-rc.json file and supply the testuser password that
was generated when the master/replica pods were generated. Then, run
the following command to deploy the pgpool service:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/primary-replica
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/pgpool
./run.sh
....

Next, you can access the master replica cluster via the pgpool
service by entering the following command:

....
psql -h pgpool -U testuser userdb
psql -h pgpool -U testuser postgres
....

When prompted, enter the password for the PG_USERNAME testuser
that was set for the pg-master pod, typically it is *password*.

At this point, you can enter SELECT and INSERT statements and
pgpool will proxy the SQL commands to the master or replica(s)
depending on the type of SQL command.  Writes will always
be sent to the master, and reads will be sent (round-robin)
to the replica(s).

You can view the nodes that pgpool is configured for by
running:
....
psql -h pgpool -U testuser userdb -c 'show pool_nodes'
....

=== pgbadger

==== Docker

A pgbadger example is provided that will run a HTTP server that
when invoked, will generate a pgbadger report on a given database.

pgbadger reads the log files from a database to product an HTML report
that shows various PostgreSQL statistics and graphs.

To run the example, modify the run-badger.sh script to refer to the
Docker container that you want to run pgbadger against, also referring
to the container's data directory, then run the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/badger
./run.sh
....

After execution, the container will run and provide a simple HTTP
command you can browse to view the report.  As you run queries against
the database, you can invoke this URL to generate updated reports:
....
curl http://127.0.0.1:14000/api/badgergenerate
....

==== Kubernetes

This example runs a pod that includes a database container and
a pgbadger container. A service is also created for the pod.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/badger
./run.sh
....

You can access pgbadger at:
....
curl http://badger:10000/api/badgergenerate
....

*Tip*

You can view the database container logs using this command:
....
kubectl logs -c server badger
....

==== OpenShift

This example creates a pod that contains a database container and
a pgbadger container.

*pgbadger* is then served up on port 10000.  Each time you do a
GET on http://pg-master:10000/api/badgergenerate
it will run pgbadger against the database log files running in the
pg-master container.

golang is required to build the pgbadger container, on RH 7.2, golang
is found in the 'server optional' repository and needs to be enabled
to install.

To run the example:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/badger
./run.sh
....

try the following command to see the generated HTML output:

....
curl http://badger-example:10000/api/badgergenerate
....

You can view this output in a browser if you allow port forwarding
from your container to your server host using a command like
this:

....
socat tcp-listen:10001,reuseaddr,fork tcp:pg-master:10000
....

This command maps port 10000 of the service/container to port
10001 of the local server.  You can now use your browser to
see the badger report.

This is a short-cut way to expose a service to the external world,
OpenShift would normally configure a router whereby you could
'expose' the service in an OpenShift way.  Here are the docs
on installing OpenShift on a router:

....
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/install_config/install/deploy_router.html
....

=== Metrics Collection

==== Docker

You can collect various PostgreSQL metrics from your database
container by running a crunchy-collect container that points
to your database container.

To start this set of containers, run the following:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/basic
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/metrics
./run.sh
....

These metrics are fully described in this link:metrics.adoc[document.]

An example has been provided that runs a database container
in addition to the associated metrics collection container. Run the
example as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/collect
./run.sh
....

This will start up 3 containers and services:

 * Prometheus (http://crunchy-prometheus:9090)
 * Prometheus gateway (http://crunchy-promgateway:9091)
 * Grafana (http://crunchy-grafana:3000)

Every 3 minutes the collection container will collect PostgreSQL
metrics and push them to the crunchy-prometheus database.  You
can graph them using the crunchy-grafana container.

If firewalld is enabled in your environment, it may be necessary
to allow the necessary ports through the firewall. This can be
accomplished by the following:

....
firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone metrics
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9090/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9091/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 3000/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
....

==== Kubernetes

This example starts up Prometheus, Grafana, and Prometheus gateway.

It is required to view or capture metrics collected by crunchy-collect.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/metrics
./run.sh
....

This will start up 3 containers and services:

 * Prometheus (http://crunchy-prometheus:9090)
 * Prometheus gateway (http://crunchy-promgateway:9091)
 * Grafana (http://crunchy-grafana:3000)

If you want your metrics and dashboards to persist to NFS, run
this script:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/metrics
./run-pvc.sh
....

In the /docs/ folder of the GitHub repository, check out the link:metrics.adoc[metrics documentation]
for details on the exact metrics being collected.

This example runs a pod that includes a database container and
a metrics collection container. A service is also created for the pod.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/collect
./run.sh
....

If firewalld is enabled in your environment, it may be necessary
to allow the necessary ports through the firewall. This can be
accomplished by the following:

....
firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone metrics
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9090/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9091/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 3000/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
....

You can view the collect container logs using this command:
....
kubectl logs -c collect master-collect
....

You can access the database or drive load against it using
this command:
....
psql -h master-collect -U postgres postgres
....

==== OpenShift

This example shows how PostgreSQL metrics can be collected
and stored in Prometheus and graphed with Grafana.

First, create the crunchy-metrics pod which contains
the Prometheus data store and the Grafana graphing web application:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/metrics
./run.sh
....

At this point, you can view the Prometheus web console at
crunchy-metrics:9090, the Prometheus push gateway at crunchy-metrics:9091,
and the Grafana web app at crunchy-metrics:3000.

Next, start a PostgreSQL pod that has the crunchy-collect container
as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/collect
./run.sh
....

At this point, metrics will be collected every 3 minutes and pushed
to Prometheus.  You can build graphs off the metrics using Grafana.

If firewalld is enabled in your environment, it may be necessary
to allow the necessary ports through the firewall. This can be
accomplished by the following:

....
firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone metrics
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9090/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 9091/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone metrics --add-port 3000/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
....

=== Vacuum

==== Docker

You can perform a PostgreSQL vacuum command by running the crunchy-vacuum
container.  You specify a database to vacuum using environment variables.

An example is shown in the $CCPROOT/examples/docker/vacuum/run.sh script
and can be run as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/vacuum
./run.sh
....

This example performs a vacuum on a single table in the master PostgreSQL
database. The crunchy-vacuum image is executed, passed in
the PostgreSQL connection parameters to the single-master PostgreSQL
container.  The type of vacuum performed is dictated by the
environment variables passed into the job. Vacuum is controlled via the following
environment variables:

 * VAC_FULL - when set to true adds the FULL parameter to the VACUUM command
 * VAC_TABLE - when set, allows you to specify a single table to vacuum, when
 not specified, the entire database tables are vacuumed
 * JOB_HOST - required variable is the PostgreSQL host we connect to
 * PG_USER - required variable is the PostgreSQL user we connect with
 * PG_DATABASE - required variable is the PostgreSQL database we connect to
 * PG_PASSWORD - required variable is the PostgreSQL user password we connect with
 * PG_PORT - allows you to override the default value of 5432
 * VAC_ANALYZE - when set to true adds the ANALYZE parameter to the VACUUM command
 * VAC_VERBOSE - when set to true adds the VERBOSE parameter to the VACUUM command
 * VAC_FREEZE - when set to true adds the FREEZE parameter to the VACUUM command

==== Kubernetes

This example runs a Job which performs a SQL VACUUM on a particular
table (testtable) in the basic database instance.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kubernetes/basic
./run.sh
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/vacuum-job/
./run.sh
....

Verify the job is completed:
....
kubectl get job
....

View the docker log of the vacuum job's pod:
....
docker logs $(docker ps -a | grep crunchy-vacuum | cut -f 1 -d' ')
....

This example performs a vacuum on a single table in the master PostgreSQL
database. The crunchy-vacuum image is executed, passed in
the PostgreSQL connection parameters to the single-master PostgreSQL
container.  The type of vacuum performed is dictated by the
environment variables passed into the job. Vacuum is controlled via the following
environment variables:

 * VAC_FULL - when set to true adds the FULL parameter to the VACUUM command
 * VAC_TABLE - when set, allows you to specify a single table to vacuum, when
 not specified, the entire database tables are vacuumed
 * JOB_HOST - required variable is the PostgreSQL host we connect to
 * PG_USER - required variable is the PostgreSQL user we connect with
 * PG_DATABASE - required variable is the PostgreSQL database we connect to
 * PG_PASSWORD - required variable is the PostgreSQL user password we connect with
 * PG_PORT - allows you to override the default value of 5432
 * VAC_ANALYZE - when set to true adds the ANALYZE parameter to the VACUUM command
 * VAC_VERBOSE - when set to true adds the VERBOSE parameter to the VACUUM command
 * VAC_FREEZE - when set to true adds the FREEZE parameter to the VACUUM command

==== OpenShift

This example shows how you can run a vacuum job against
a PostgreSQL database container.

The crunchy-vacuum container image exists to allow a DBA
a way to run a job either individually or scheduled to perform
a variety of vacuum operations.

To run the vacuum a single time, an example database to run this
against is included as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/primary-replica
./run.sh
cd ../vacuum-job
./run.sh
....

This example performs a vacuum on a single table in the master PostgreSQL
database. The crunchy-vacuum image is executed, passed in
the PostgreSQL connection parameters to the single-master PostgreSQL
container.  The type of vacuum performed is dictated by the
environment variables passed into the job. Vacuum is controlled via the following
environment variables:

 * VAC_FULL - when set to true adds the FULL parameter to the VACUUM command
 * VAC_TABLE - when set, allows you to specify a single table to vacuum, when
 not specified, the entire database tables are vacuumed
 * JOB_HOST - required variable is the PostgreSQL host we connect to
 * PG_USER - required variable is the PostgreSQL user we connect with
 * PG_DATABASE - required variable is the PostgreSQL database we connect to
 * PG_PASSWORD - required variable is the PostgreSQL user password we connect with
 * PG_PORT - allows you to override the default value of 5432
 * VAC_ANALYZE - when set to true adds the ANALYZE parameter to the VACUUM command
 * VAC_VERBOSE - when set to true adds the VERBOSE parameter to the VACUUM command
 * VAC_FREEZE - when set to true adds the FREEZE parameter to the VACUUM command

=== Cron Scheduler

==== Kubernetes

The crunchy-dba container implements a cron scheduler. The purpose of the crunchy-dba
container is to offer a way to perform simple DBA tasks that occur on some form of
schedule such as backup jobs or running a vacuum on a single PostgreSQL database container.
Both of these examples are provided as scripts.

You can either run the crunchy-dba container as a single pod or include the container
within a database pod.

The crunchy-dba container makes use of a Service Account to perform the startup of
scheduled jobs. The Kube Job type is used to execute the scheduled jobs with a Restart
policy of Never.

The script to schedule vacuum on a regular schedule is executed through the following
commands:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/dba
./run-vac.sh
....

To run the script for scheduled backups, run the following in the same directory:

....
./run-backup.sh
....

Individual parameters for both can be modified within their respective JSON files;
please see link:containers.adoc for a full list of what can be modified.

=== Customized Docker Setup

==== Docker

You can use your own version of the setup.sql SQL file to customize
the initialization of database data and objects when the container and
database are created.

An example is shown in the $CCPROOT/examples/docker/custom-setup/run.sh script
and can be run as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/custom-setup
./run.sh
....

This works by placing a file named, setup.sql, within the /pgconf mounted volume
directory.  Portions of the setup.sql file are required for the crunchy container
to work, see comments within the sample setup.sql file.

=== pgbouncer

==== Docker

The pgbouncer utility can be used to provide a connection pool
to PostgreSQL databases.  The crunchy-pgbouncer container also
contains logic that lets it perform a failover from a master
to a replica database.

To test this failover, you first create a running master/replica
cluster as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/primary-replica
./run.sh
....

An example is shown in the $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgbouncer/run.sh script
and can be run as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgbouncer
./run.sh
....

This example configures pgbouncer to provide connection pooling
for the master and pg-replica databases.  It also sets the FAILOVER
environment variable which will cause a failover to be triggered
if the master database can not be reached.

To trigger the failover, stop the master database:

....
docker stop master
....

At this point, the pgbouncer will notice that the master is not reachable
and touch the trigger file on the configured replica database to start
the failover.  The pgbouncer container will then reconfigure
pgbouncer to relabel the replica database into the master database so clients
to pgbouncer will be able to connect to the master as before the failover.

To just log into the database from the pgbouncer connection pool
you would enter the following using the password "password":
....
psql -h localhost -p 12005 -U testuser master
....

==== Kubernetes

*Note*: This example assumes you have run the primary-replica example prior
to this example!

This example runs a crunchy-pgbouncer container to look for the
master within a PostgreSQL cluster, if it can not find the master it
will proceed to cause a failover to a replica.  It will also configure
a pgbouncer container that sets up a connection pool to the
configured master and replica.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgbouncer
./run.sh
....

Connect to the *master* and *replica* databases as follows:
....
psql -h pgbouncer -U postgres master
psql -h pgbouncer -U postgres replica
....

The names *master* and *replica* are pgbouncer configured names
and don't necessarily have to match the database name in the
actual PostgreSQL instance.

View the pgbouncer log as follows:
....
kubectl log pgbouncer
....

Next, test the failover capability within the crunchy-watch
container using the following:
....
kubectl delete pod master
....

Take another look at the pgbouncer log and you will see it trigger
the failover to the replica pod.  After this failover
you should be able to execute the command:
....
psql -h pgbouncer -U postgres master
....

==== OpenShift

This example shows how you can use the crunchy-pgbouncer container
when running under OpenShift.

The example assumes you have run the primary/replica example
found here:
....
$CCPROOT/examples/openshift/primary-replica-dc
./run.sh
....

Then you would start up the pgbouncer container using the following
example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/pgbouncer
./run.sh
....

The example assumes you have an NFS share path of /nfsfileshare/!  NFS
is required to mount the pgbouncer configuration files which are
then mounted to /pgconf in the crunchy-pgbouncer container.

If you mount a /pgconf volume, crunchy-postgres will look at that directory
for postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, and setup.sql.  If it finds one of them it
will use that file instead of the default files.

Test the example by killing off the primary database container as
follows:
....
oc delete pod primary-dc
....

Then watch the pgbouncer log as follows to confirm it detects the loss
of the primary:
....
oc logs pgbouncer
....

After the failover is completed, you should be able to access
the new primary using the primary service as follows:
....
psql -h primary-dc.openshift.svc.cluster.local -U master postgres
....

and access the replica as follows:
....
psql -h replica-dc.openshift.svc.cluster.local -U master postgres
....

or via the pgbouncer proxy as follows:
....
psql -h pgbouncer.openshift.svc.cluster.local  -U master master
....

=== Synchronous Replication

==== Docker

This example, $CCPROOT/examples/docker/sync, provides a
streaming replication configuration that includes both
synchronous and asynchronous replicas.

To run this example, run the following:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/sync
./run.sh
....

You can test the replication status on the master by using the following command
and the password "password":
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12000 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

You should see 2 rows, 1 for the async replica and 1 for the sync replica.  The
sync_state column shows values of async or sync.

You can test replication to the replicas by entering some data on
the master like this, and then querying the replicas for that data:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12000 -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12000 -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12002 -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12003 -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
....

==== Kubernetes

This example deploys a PostgreSQL cluster with a master,
a synchronous replica, and an asynchronous replica.  The
two replicas share the same Service.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/sync
./run.sh
....

Connect to the *mastersync* and *replicasync* databases as follows:
....
psql -h mastersync -U postgres postgres -c 'create table mister (id int)'
psql -h mastersync -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into mister values (1)'
psql -h mastersync -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from mister'
psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from mister'
psql -h replicasync -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from mister'
....

This set of queries will show you the IP address of the PostgreSQL replica
container, notice it changes because of the round-robin Service proxy
we are using for both replicas.  The example queries also show that both
replicas are replicating from the master.

==== OpenShift

This example deploys a PostgreSQL cluster with a master,
a synchrounous replica, and an asynchronous replica.  The
two replicas share the same Service.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/sync
./run.sh
....

Connect to the *master* and *replica* databases as follows:
....
psql -h master -U postgres postgres -c 'create table mister (id int)'
psql -h master -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into mister values (1)'
psql -h master -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
psql -h replica -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from mister'
psql -h replica -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from mister'
psql -h replica -U postgres postgres -c 'select inet_server_addr(), * from mister'
....

This set of queries will show you the IP address of the PostgreSQL replica
container, notice it changes because of the round-robin Service proxy
we are using for both replicas.  The example queries also show that both
replicas are replicating from the master.

=== Statefulsets

==== Kubernetes

This example deploys a statefulset named *pgset*.  The statefulset
is a new feature in Kubernetes as of version 1.5.  Statefulsets have
replaced PetSets going forward.

This example creates 2 PostgreSQL containers to form the set.  At
startup, each container will examine its hostname to determine
if it is the first container within the set of containers.

The first container is determined by the hostname suffix assigned
by Kube to the pod.  This is an ordinal value starting with *0*.

If a container sees that it has an ordinal value of *0*, it will
update the container labels to add a new label of:
....
name=$PG_PRIMARY_HOST
....

In this example, PG_PRIMARY_HOST is specified as *pgset-master*.

By default, the containers specify a value of *name=pgset-replica*

There are 2 services that end user applications will use to
access the PostgreSQL cluster, one service (pgset-master) routes to the master
container and the other (pgset-replica) to the replica containers.

....
$ kubectl get service
NAME            CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    22h
pgset           None            <none>        5432/TCP   1h
pgset-master    10.97.168.138   <none>        5432/TCP   1h
pgset-replica   10.97.218.221   <none>        5432/TCP   1h
....

Start the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/statefulset
./run.sh
....


You can access the master database as follows:
....
psql -h pgset-master -U postgres postgres
....

You can access the replica databases as follows:
....
psql -h pgset-replica -U postgres postgres
....

You can scale the number of containers using this command, this will
essentially create an additional replica databse:
....
kubectl scale pgset --replica=3
....

==== OpenShift

This example shows how to use a StatefulSet (available
in OpenShift Origin 3.5) to create a PostgreSQL cluster.

Build the example by:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/statefulset
./run.sh
....

This will create a statefulset named pgset, which will create
2 pods, pgset-0 and pgset-1:
....
oc get statefulset
oc get pod
....

A service is created for the master and another service for the replica:
....
oc get service
....

The statefulset ordinal value of 0 is used to determine which pod
will act as the PostgreSQL master, all other ordinal values will
assume the replica role.

=== Statefulsets using Dynamic Provisioning

==== Kubernetes

The example in *examples/statefulset-dyn* is almost an exact copy of the
previous statefulset example; however, this example uses
Dynamic Storage Provisioning to automatically create Persistent
Volume Claims based on StorageClasses.  This Kube feature is
available on Google Container Engine which this example was
tested upon.

You can run the example as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/statefulset-dyn
./run.sh
....

This will create a StorageClass named *slow* which you can view using:
....
kubectl get storageclass
NAME      TYPE
slow      kubernetes.io/gce-pd
....

The example causes Kube to create the required PVCs automatically:
....
kubectl get pvc

=== Kubernetes Secrets

==== OpenShift

You can use Kubernetes Secrets to set and maintain your database
credentials.  Secrets requires you base64 encode your user and password
values as follows:

....
echo -n 'myuserid' | base64
....

You will paste these values into  your JSON secrets files for values.

This example allows you to set the PostgreSQL passwords
using Kube Secrets.

The secret uses a base64 encoded string to represent the
values to be read by the container during initialization.  The
encoded password value is *password*.  Run the example
as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/secret
./run.sh
....

The secrets are mounted in the */pguser*, */pgmaster*, */pgroot* volumes within the
container and read during initialization.  The container
scripts create a PostgreSQL user with those values, and sets the passwords
for the master user and PostgreSQL superuser using the mounted secret volumes.

When using secrets, you do NOT have to specify the following
environment variables if you specify all three secrets volumes:

 * PG_USER
 * PG_PASSWORD
 * PG_ROOT_PASSWORD
 * PG_PRIMARY_USER
 * PG_MASTER_PASSWORD

You can test the container as follows, in all cases, the password is *password*:
....
psql -h secret-pg -U pguser1 postgres
psql -h secret-pg -U postgres postgres
psql -h secret-pg -U master postgres
....

Secrets requires you base64 encode your user and password
values as follows:

....
echo -n 'myuserid' | base64
....

You can paste these values into your JSON secrets files for values.

=== pitr - PITR (point in time recovery)

==== Docker

This example, $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pitr, provides an
example of performing a point in time recovery.

To run this example, run the following to create a
database container:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pitr
./run-master-pitr.sh
....

It takes about 1 minute for the database to become ready
for use after initially starting.

This database is created with the ARCHIVE_MODE and ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT
environment variables set.  See the link:pitr.adoc[PITR documentation]for more details
on these settings.  Warning:  this example writes the WAL segment
files to the /tmp directory...running it for a long time could
fill up your /tmp!

Next, we will create a base backup of that database using
this:
....
./run-master-pitr-backup.sh
....

At this point, WAL segment files are created every 60 seconds that
contain any database changes.  These segments are stored in
the /tmp/master-data/master-wal directory.

Next, create some data in your database using this command:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12000 -U postgres postgres -c "select pg_create_restore_point('beforechanges')"
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12000 -U postgres postgres -c 'create table pitrtest (id int)'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12000 -U postgres postgres -c "select pg_create_restore_point('afterchanges')"
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12000 -U postgres postgres -c "select pg_create_restore_point('nomorechanges')"
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12000 -U postgres postgres -c "checkpoint"
....

Next, stop the database to avoid conflicts with the WAL files while
attempting to do a restore from them:
....
docker stop master-pitr
....

The commands above set restore point labels which we can
use to mark the points in the recovery process we want to
reference when creating our restored database.  Points before
and after the test table were made.

Next, let's edit the restore script to use the base backup files
created in the step above.  You can view the backup path name
under the /tmp/backups/master-pitr-backups/ directory. You will see
another directory inside of this path with a name similar to
*2016-09-21-21-03-29*.  Copy and paste that value into the
run-restore-pitr.sh script in the *BACKUP* environment variable.

In order to restore the database before we created test table in the
last command, you'll need uncomment to the RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME label
*-e RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME=beforechanges* to define the restore target name.
After that, run the script.
....
vi ./run-restore-pitr.sh
./run-restore-pitr.sh
....

The WAL segments are read and applied when restoring from the database
backup.  At this point, you should be able to verify that the
database was restored to the point before creating the test table:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
....

This SQL command should show that the pitrtest table does not exist
at this recovery time. The output should be similar to:

PostgreSQL allows you to pause the recovery process if the target name
or time is specified.  This pause would allow a DBA a chance to review
the recovery time/name and see if this is what they want or expect.  If so,
the DBA can run the following command to resume and complete the recovery:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'select pg_xlog_replay_resume()'
....

Until you run the statement above, the database will be left in read-only
mode.

Next, run the script to restore the database
to the *afterchanges* restore point, do this by updating the
RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME to *afterchanges*:
....
vi ./run-restore-pitr.sh
./run-restore-pitr.sh
....

After this restore, you should be able to see the test table:
....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'select pg_xlog_replay_resume()'
....

Lastly, lets start a recovery using all of the WAL files. This will get the
restored database as current as possible. To do so, edit the script
to remove the RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME environment setting completely:
....
./run-restore-pitr.sh
sleep 30
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 12001 -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
....

At this point, you should be able to create new data in the restored database
and the test table should be present.  When you recover the entire
WAL history, resuming the recovery is not necessary to enable writes.

Other options exist for performing a PITR. See the link:pitr.adoc[PITR documentation] for
full details.

==== Kubernetes

This example is identical to the OpenShift PITR example; please see below for
details on how the PITR example works.

The only differences are the following:

 * paths are *examples/kube/pitr*
 * JSON and scripts are modifed to work with Kube
 * *kubectl* commands are used instead of *oc* commands
 * database services resolve to *default.svc.cluster.local* instead
   of *openshift.svc.cluster.local*

See link:pitr.adoc[PITR Documentation] for details on PITR concepts and how PITR is implemented
within the Suite.

==== OpenShift

This is a complex example.  For details on how PITR is implemented
within the Suite, see the link:pitr.adoc[PITR Documentation] for details and background.

This example, $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/pitr, provides an
example of performing a PITR using OpenShift.

Lets start by running the example database container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/pitr
./run-master-pitr.sh
....

This step will create a database container, *master-pitr*.  This
container is configured to continuously write WAL segment files
to a mounted volume (/pgwal).

After you start the database, you will create a base backup
using this command:
....
./run-master-pitr-backup.sh
....

This will create a backup and write the backup files to a persistent
volume (/pgbackup).

Next, lets create some recovery targets within the database, run
the SQL commands against the *master-pitr* database as follows:
....
./run-sql.sh
....

This will create recovery targets named *beforechanges*, *afterchanges*, and
*nomorechanges*.  It will create a table, *pitrtest*, between
the *beforechanges* and *afterchanges* targets.  It will also run a SQL
CHECKPOINT to flush out the changes to WAL segments.

Next, now that we have a base backup and a set of WAL files containing
our database changes, we can shut down the *master-pitr* database
to simulate a database failure.  Do this by running the following:
....
oc delete pod master-pitr
....

Next, we will create 3 different restored database containers based
upon the base backup and the saved WAL files.

First, we restore prior to the *beforechanges* recovery target.  This
recovery point is *before* the *pitrtest* table is created.

Edit the master-pitr-restore.json file, and edit the environment
variable to indicate we want to use the *beforechanges* recovery
point:
....
}, {
"name": "RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME",
"value": "beforechanges"
}, {
....

Then run the following to create the restored database container:
....
./run-restore-pitr.sh
....

After the database has restored, you should be able to perform
a test to see if the recovery worked as expected:
....
psql -h master-pitr-restore.openshift.svc.cluster.local -U postgres postgres -c 'table pitrtest'
psql -h master-pitr-restore.openshift.svc.cluster.local -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h master-pitr-restore.openshift.svc.cluster.local -U postgres postgres -c 'select pg_xlog_replay_resume()'
psql -h master-pitr-restore.openshift.svc.cluster.local -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
....

The output of these command should show that the *pitrtest* table is not
present.  It should also show that you can not create a new table
because the database is paused in recovery mode.  Lastly, if you
execute a *resume* command, it will show that you can now create
a table as the database has fully recovered.

You can also test that if *afterchanges* is specified, that the
*pitrtest* table is present but that the database is still in recovery
mode.

Lastly, you can test a full recovery using *all* of the WAL files, if
you remove the *RECOVERY_TARGET_NAME* environment variable completely.

The NFS portions of this example depend upon an NFS file
system with the following path configurations be present:
....
/nfsfileshare
/nfsfileshare/backups
/nfsfileshare/WAL
....

=== pgaudit

==== Docker

This example, $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgaudit, provides an
example of enabling pgaudit output.  As of release 1.3,
pgaudit is included in the crunchy-postgres container and is
added to the PostgreSQL shared library list in the postgresql.conf.

Given the numerous ways pgaudit can be configured, the exact
pgaudit configuration is left to the user to define.  pgaudit
allows you to configure auditing rules either in postgresql.conf
or within your SQL script.

For this test, we place pgaudit statements within a SQL script
and verify that auditing is enabled and working.  If you choose
to configure pgaudit via a postgresql.conf file, then you will
need to define your own custom postgresql.conf file and mount
it to override the default postgresql.conf file.

Run the following to create a database container:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgaudit
./run.sh
....

This starts a database on port 12005 on localhost.  You can then
run the test script as follows:
....
./test-pgaudit.sh
....

This test executes a SQL file which contains pgaudit configuration
statements as well as executes some basic SQL commands.  These
SQL commands will cause pgaudit to create audit log messages in
the pg_log log file created by the database container.

=== Docker Swarm

==== Docker

This example shows how to run a master and replica database
container on a Docker Swarm (v.1.12) cluster.

First, set up a cluster. The Kubernetes libvirt coreos cluster
example works well; see link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/libvirt-coreos/[coreos-libvirt-cluster.]

Next, on each node, create the Swarm using these
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/[Swarm Install instructions.]

Includes the command on the manager node:
....
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.10.1
....

Then the command on all the worker nodes:
....
 docker swarm join \
     --token SWMTKN-1-65cn5wa1qv76l8l45uvlsbprogyhlprjpn27p1qxjwqmncn37o-015egopg4jhtbmlu04faon82u \
         192.168.10.1.37
....

Before creating Swarm services, for service discovery you need
to define an overlay network to be used by the services you will
create.  Create the network like this:
....
docker network create --driver overlay crunchynet
....

We want to have the master database always placed on
a specific node. This is accomplished using node constraints
as follows:
....
docker node inspect kubernetes-node-1 | grep ID
docker node update --label-add type=master 18yrb7m650umx738rtevojpqy
....

In the above example, the kubernetes-node-1 node with ID 18yrb7m650umx738rtevojpqy has a user defined label of *master* added to it.  The master service
specifies *master* as a constraint when created; this tells Swarm
to place the service on that specific node.  The replica specifies
a constraint of *node.labels.type != master* to have the replica
always placed on a node that is not hosting the master service.


After you set up the Swarm cluster, you can then
run the *$CCPROOT/examples/docker/swarm-service* example as follows
on the *Swarm Manager Node*:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/swarm-service
./run.sh
....

You can then find the nodes that are running the master and replica containers
by:
....
docker service ps master
docker service ps replica
....

You can also scale up the number of *replica* containers.
....
docker service scale replica=2
docker service ls
....

Verify you have two replicas within PostgreSQL by viewing the *pg_stat_replication* table.
The password is *password* by default when logged into the kubernetes-node-1 host:
....
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q) psql -U postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication' postgres
....

You should see a row for each replica along with its replication status.

=== Automated Failover

==== Docker

This example shows how to run the crunchy-watch container
to perform an automated failover.  For the example to
work, the host on which you are running needs to allow
read-write access to /run/docker.sock.  The crunchy-watch
container runs as the *postgres* user, so adjust the
file permissions of /run/docker.sock accordingly.

Run the example as follows (depends on primary-replica example
being run prior):
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/watch
./run.sh
....

This will start the watch container which tests every few seconds
whether the master database is running, if not, it will
trigger a failover (using docker exec) on the replica host.

Test it out by stopping the master:
....
docker stop master
docker logs watch
....

Look at the watch container logs to see it perform the failover.

==== Kubernetes

This example assumes you have run the primary-replica example prior
to this example!

This example runs a crunchy-watch container to look for the
master within a PostgreSQL cluster, if it can not find the master it
will proceed to cause a failover to a replica.

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/watch
./run.sh
....

Check out the log of the watch container as follows:
....
kubectl log watch
....

Then trigger a failover using this command:
....
kubectl delete pod master
....

Resume watching the watch container's log and verify that it
detects the master is not reachable and performs a failover
on the replica.

A final test is to see if the old replica is now a fully functioning
master by inserting some test data into it as follows:
....
psql -h master -U postgres postgres -c 'create table failtest (id int)'
....

The above command still works because the watch container has
changed the labels of the replica to make it a master, so the master
service will still work and route now to the new master even though
the pod is named replica.

*Tip*

You can view the labels on a pod with this command:
....
kubectl describe pod replica | grep Label
....

==== OpenShift

This example shows how a form of automated failover can be
configured for a primary and replica deployment.

First, create a primary and a replica. In this case, the primary lives in a
deployment which can scale up:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/primary-replica-dc
./run.sh
....

Next, create an OpenShift service account which is used by the crunchy-watch
container to perform the failover. Also, set policies that allow the
service account the ability to edit resources within the OpenShift and
default projects:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/watch
oc create -f watch-sa.json
oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts -n openshift
oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts -n default
....

Next, create the container that will 'watch' the PostgreSQL cluster:

....
./run.sh
....

At this point, the watcher will sleep every 20 seconds (configurable) to
see if the primary is responding. If the primary doesn't respond, the watcher
will perform the following logic:

 * log into OpenShift using the service account
 * set its current project
 * find the first replica pod
 * delete the primary service saving off the primary service definition
 * create the trigger file on the first replica pod
 * wait 20 seconds for the failover to complete on the replica pod
 * edit the replica pod's label to match that of the primary
 * recreate the primary service using the stored service definition
 * loop through the other remaining replica and delete its pod

At this point, clients when access the primary's service will actually
be accessing the new primary.  Also, OpenShift will recreate the number
of replicas to its original configuration which each replica pointed to the
new primary.  Replication from the primary to the new replicas will be
started as each new replica is started by OpenShift.

To test it out, delete the primary pod and view the watch pod log:
....
oc delete pod primary-dc
oc logs watch
oc get pod
....

=== SSL Authentication

==== OpenShift

This example shows how you can configure PostgreSQL to use SSL for
client authentication.

The example is found at:
....
./examples/openshift/customer-config-ssl
....

The example requires SSL keys to be created, the example script
*keys.sh* is required to be executed to create the required
server and client certificates.  This script also creates
a client key configuration you can use to test with.

The example requires an NFS volume, /pgconf, be mounted into which
the PostgreSQL configuration files and keys are copied to.  Permissions
of the keys are important as well, they will need to be owned
by either the *root* or *postgres* user.  The *run.sh* script
copies the required files and sets these permissions when executing the example.

The *keys.sh* script creates a client cert with the *testuser* specified
as the CN.  The *testuser* PostgreSQL user is created by the *setup.sql*
configuration script as normal.  It is with the *testuser* role that
you will test with.

Run the PostgreSQL example as follows:
....
./run.sh
....

A required step to make this example work is to define
in your */etc/hosts* file an entry that maps *server.crunchydata.com*
to the example's service IP address, this is because we generate
a server certificate with the server name of *server.crunchyhdata.com*.

For example, if your service has an address as follows:
....
 oc get service
NAME                CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                   AGE
custom-config-ssl   172.30.211.108   <none>        5432/TCP
....

Then your */etc/hosts* file needs an entry like this:
....
172.30.211.108 server.crunchydata.com
....

For a production Openshift installation, you'll likely want DNS
names to resolve to the PostgreSQL Service name and generate
server certificates using the DNS names instead of an example
name like *server.crunchydata.com*.

Once the container starts up, you can test the SSL connection
as follows:
....
psql -h server.crunchydata.com -U testuser userdb
....

You should see a connection that looks like the following:
....
psql (9.6.3)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

userdb=>
....


=== OpenShift Templates Configuration

==== OpenShift

This example, $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/workshop, provides an
example of using OpenShift Templates to build pods, routes, services, etc.

You use the *oc new-app* command to create objects from the
JSON templates.  This is an alternative way to create OpenShift objects
instead of using *oc create*.

This example is used within a joint Redhat-Crunchy workshop that is
given at various conferences to demonstrate OpenShift and Crunchy Containers
working together.  Thanks to Steven Pousty from Redhat for this
example!

See the README file within the workshop directory for instructions
on running the example.

=== pg_upgrade

==== Kubernetes

Starting in release 1.3.1, the upgrade container will let
you perform a pg_upgrade on a 9.5 database converting its data
to a 9.6 version.

This example assumes you have run *master-pvc* using a PG 9.5 image
such as *centos7-9.5-1.5* prior to running this upgrade.

Prior to starting this example, shut down the *master-pvc* database
using the *examples/kube/master-pvc/cleanup.sh* script.

Prior to running this example, make sure your CCP_IMAGE_TAG
environment variable is using a PG 9.6 image such as *centos7-9.6-1.5*.

Start the upgrade as follows:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/upgrade
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:

 * a Kube Job running the *crunchy-upgrade* container
 * a new data directory name *master-upgrade* found in the *pgnewdata*
 PVC

If successful, the Job will end with a Successful status, verify
the results of the Job by examining the Job's pod log:
....
kubectl get pod -a -l job-name=upgrade-job
kubectl logs -l job-name=upgrade-job
....

You can verify the upgraded database by running the
*examples/kube/master-upgrade*
example, this example will mount the newly created and upgraded
database files.  Database tables and data that were in the *master-pvc*
test database should be found in the *master-upgrade* database.

=== Kubernetes Google Cloud Environment

==== Kubernetes

The PostgreSQL Container Suite was tested on Google Container Engine.

Here is a link to set up a Kube cluster on GCE:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/gce

Setup the persistent disks using GCE disks by first editing
*examples/envvars.sh* and set the GCE settings to match your
GCE environment.

Then create the PVs used by the examples, passing in the *gce*
value as a parameter. This will cause the GCE disks to be created:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/pv
./create-pv.sh gce
cd $CCPROOT/examples/pv
./create-pvc.sh
....

Here is a link that describes more information on GCE persistent disk:
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/tutorials/persistent-disk/


To have the persistent disk examples work, you will need to specify
a *fsGroup* setting in the *SecurityContext* of each pod script
as follows:
....
       "securityContext": {
        "fsGroup": 26
        },
....

For our PostgreSQL container, a UID of 26 is specified as the user
which corresponds to the *fsGroup* value.

== Docker - Tips

=== Send a signal to PostgreSQL

First, find the PID of the postmaster:
....
docker exec -it master cat /pgdata/master/postmaster.pid
....

Then, send it the signal to kill it or other signal depending on what you want to do:

....
docker exec -it master kill -SIGTERM 22
....

== OpenShift - Tips

=== PostgreSQL Passwords

The passwords used for the PostgreSQL user accounts are generated
by the OpenShift 'process' command.  To inspect what value was
supplied, you can inspect the master pod as follows:

....
oc get pod ms-master -o json | grep PG
....

Look for the values of the environment variables:

 *  PG_USER
 *  PG_PASSWORD
 *  PG_DATABASE

=== Password Management

When you backup a database, the original user IDs and password credentials
are copied over from the original database and saved. Because of this, you
cannot use generated passwords as the new passwords will not be the same as the
passwords stored in the backup.

You have various options to deal with managing your
passwords:

 * externalize your passwords using secrets instead of using generated values
 * manually update your passwords to your known values after a restore

*Note*: Environment variables can be modified when there is a a deployment
controller in use. Currently, only the replicas have a deployment controller in
order to avoid the possibility of creating multiple masters.
....
oc env dc/pg-master-rc PG_MASTER_PASSWORD=foo PG_MASTER=user1
....

=== Examine Backup Logs

Database backups are implemented as a Kubernetes Job. These are meant to run one time only
and not be restarted by Kubernetes. To view jobs in OpenShift you enter:

....
oc get jobs
oc describe job backupjob
....

You can get detailed logs by referring to the pod identifier in the job 'describe'
output as follows:

....
oc logs backupjob-pxh2o
....

=== Backups

Backups require the use of network storage like NFS in OpenShift.
There is a required order of using NFS volumes in the manner
we do database backups.

There is a one-to-one relationship between a PV (persistent volume) and a PVC
(persistence volume claim).  You can NOT have a one-to-many relationship between
PV and PVC(s).

So, to do a database backup repeatedly, this general pattern will need to be followed.

 * as OpenShift admin user, create a unique PV (e.g. backup-pv-mydatabase)
 * as a project user, create a unique PVC (e.g. backup-pvc-mydatabase)
 * reference the unique PVC within the backup-job template
 * execute the backup job template
 * as a project user, delete the job
 * as a project user, delete the PVC
 * as OpenShift admin user, delete the unique PV

This procedure will need to be scripted and executed by the devops team when
performing a database backup.

=== Restores

To perform a database restore, we do the following:

 * locate the NFS path to the database backup we want to restore with
 * edit a PV to use that NFS path
 * edit a PV to specify a unique label
 * create the PV
 * edit a PVC to use the previously created PV, specifying the same label
   used in the PV
 * edit a database template, specifying the PVC to be used for mounting
   to the /backup directory in the database pod
 * create the database pod

If the /pgdata directory is blank AND the /backup directory contains
a valid PostgreSQL backup, it is assumed the user wants to perform a
database restore.

The restore logic will copy /backup files to /pgdata before starting
the database.  It will take time for the copying of the files to
occur since this might be a large amount of data and the volumes
might be on slow networks. You can view the logs of the database pod
to measure the copy progress.

=== Log Aggregation

OpenShift can be configured to include the EFK stack for log aggregation.
OpenShift Administrators can configure the EFK stack as documented
here:

https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/aggregate_logging.html

=== nss_wrapper

If an OpenShift deployment requires that random generated UIDs be
supported by containers, the Crunchy containers can be modified
similar to those located here to support the use of nss_wrapper
to equate the random generated UIDs/GIDs by OpenShift with
the postgres user.

https://github.com/openshift/postgresql/blob/master/9.4/root/usr/share/container-scripts/postgresql/common.sh
