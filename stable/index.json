	"content": " Overview The following provides a high level overview of each of the container images.\nCentOS vs Red Hat UBI Images The Crunchy Container suite provides three different OS images: centos7, ubi7, and ubi8-minimal. Both images utilize Crunchy Ceritifed RPM\u0026rsquo;s for the installation of PostgreSQL, and outside of the base images utilized to build the containers and any packages included within them (either CentOS or UBI), both are effectively the same. The ubi7 and ubi8-minimal images are available to active Crunchy Data Customers only, and are built using the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI).\nPlease note that as of version 4.2.2 of the Crunchy Containers Suite, the ubi7 images have replaced the rhel7 images included in previous versions of the container suite. For more information on Red Hat UBI, please see the following link:\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image\nDatabase Images Crunchy Container Suite provides two types of PostgreSQL database images:\n Crunchy PostgreSQL Crunchy PostGIS  Supported major versions of these images are:\n 13 12 11 10  Crunchy PostgreSQL Crunchy PostgreSQL is an unmodified deployment of the PostgreSQL relational database. It supports the following features:\n Asynchronous and synchronous replication Mounting custom configuration files such as pg_hba.conf, postgresql.conf and setup.sql Can be configured to use SSL authentication Logging to container logs Dedicated users for: administration, monitoring, connection pooler authentication, replication and user applications. pgBackRest backups built into the container Archiving WAL to dedicated volume mounts Extensions available in the PostgreSQL contrib module. Enhanced audit logging from the pgAudit extension Enhanced database statistics from the pg_stat_tatements extensions Python Procedural Language from the PL/Python extensions Backups  Logical: pg_dump and pg_restore are included as logical backup and restore tools. These can be used to export and import SQL that recreates the database Physical: pg_basebackup is included as a physical backup tool. This can be used to backup the files that comprise the database  Benchmarking with pgbench  Running Modes The Crunchy PostgreSQL container can be run in modes, specified by setting the MODE environment variable, enabling different features. Detailed information for configuring the crunchy-postgres container running modes can be found in the container specification documentation.\nBackup The backup mode allows users to create pg_basebackup physical backups. The backups created by Crunchy Backup can be mounted to the Crunchy PostgreSQL container to restore databases.\npgBasebackup-restore The pgbasebasebackup-restore mode allows users to restore from a pg_basebackup physical backup using rsync.\npgDump The pgdump mode creates a logical backup of the database using the pg_dump tool. It supports the following features:\n pg_dump individual databases pg_dump all databases various formats of backups: plain (SQL), custom (compressed archive), directory (directory with one file for each table and blob being dumped with a table of contents) and tar (uncompressed tar archive) Logical backups of database sections such as: DDL, data only, indexes, schema  pgRestore The pgrestore mode allows users to restore a PostgreSQL database from pg_dump logical backups using the pg_restore tool.\nSqlrunner The sqlrunner mode uses psql to run all of the SQL files that are provided in the /pgconf volume.\npgBench The pgbench mode allows users to run benchmarking tests on PostgreSQL using pgbench\nCrunchy PostgreSQL PostGIS The Crunchy PostgreSQL PostGIS mirrors all the features of the Crunchy PostgreSQL image but additionally provides the following geospatial extensions:\n PostGIS PostGIS Topology PostGIS Tiger Geocoder FuzzyStrMatch  Backup and Restoration Options Crunchy Container Suite provides support for two types of backups:\n Physical - backups of the files that comprise the database Logical - an export of the SQL that recreates the database  Physical backup and restoration tools included in the Crunchy Container suite are:\n pgBackRest PostgreSQL images pg_basebackup - provided by the Crunchy PostgreSQL image  Logical backup and restoration tools are:\n pg_dump - provided by the Crunchy PostgreSQL image pg_restore - provided by the Crunchy PostgreSQL image  Crunchy BackRest Restore The Crunchy BackRest Restore image restores a PostgreSQL database from pgBackRest physical backups. This image supports the following types of restores:\n Full - all database cluster files are restored and PostgreSQL replays Write Ahead Logs (WAL) to the latest point in time. Requires an empty data directory. Delta - missing files for the database cluster are restored and PostgreSQL replays Write Ahead Logs (WAL) to the latest point in time. PITR - missing files for the database cluster are restored and PostgreSQL replays Write Ahead Logs (WAL) to a specific point in time.  Visit the official pgBackRest website for more information: https://pgbackrest.org/\nAdministration The following images can be used to administer and maintain Crunchy PostgreSQL database containers.\nCrunchy pgAdmin4 The Crunchy pgAdmin4 images allows users to administer their Crunchy PostgreSQL containers via a graphical user interface web application.\nVisit the official pgAdmin4 website for more information: https://www.pgadmin.org/\nCrunchy Upgrade The Crunchy Upgrade image allows users to perform major upgrades of their Crunchy PostgreSQL containers. The following upgrade versions of PostgreSQL are available:\n 13 12 11 10 9.6 9.5  Performance and Monitoring The following images can be used to understand how Crunchy PostgreSQL containers are performing over time using tools such as pgBadger.\nCrunchy pgBadger The Crunchy pgBadger image provides a tool that parses PostgreSQL logs and generates an in-depth statistical report. Crunchy pgBadger reports include:\n Connections Sessions Checkpoints Vacuum Locks Queries  Additionally Crunchy pgBadger can be configured to store reports for analysis over time.\nVisit the official pgBadger website for more information: https://pgbadger.darold.net/\nConnection Pooling and Logical Routers Crunchy pgBouncer The Crunchy pgBouncer image provides a lightweight PostgreSQL connection pooler. Using pgBouncer, users can lower overhead of opening new connections and control traffic to their PostgreSQL databases. Crunchy pgBouncer supports the following features:\n Connection pooling Drain, Pause, Stop connections to Crunchy PostgreSQL containers Dedicated pgBouncer user for authentication queries Dynamic user authentication  Visit the official pgBouncer website for more information: https://pgbouncer.github.io\nCrunchy pgPool II The Crunchy pgPool image provides a logical router and connection pooler for Crunchy PostgreSQL containers. pgPool examines SQL queries and redirects write queries to the primary and read queries to replicas. This allows users to setup a single entrypoint for their applications without requiring knowledge of read replicas. Additionally pgPool provides connection pooling to lower overhead of opening new connections to Crunchy PostgreSQL containers.\nVisit the official pgPool II website for more information: http://www.pgpool.net\n"

Portions of the setup.sql file are required for the container to work; please see comments within the sample setup.sql file.\nIf you mount a /pgconf volume, crunchy-postgres will look at that directory for postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, pg_ident.conf, SSL server/ca certificates and setup.sql. If it finds one of them it will use that file instead of the default files.\nDocker This example can be run as follows for the Docker environment:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/custom-config ./run.sh  Kubernetes and OpenShift Running the example:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config ./run.sh  "

	"description": "",
	"content": " SSL Authentication This example shows how you can configure PostgreSQL to use SSL for client authentication.\nThe example requires SSL certificates and keys to be created. Included in the examples directory is a script to create self-signed certificates (server and client) for the example: $CCPROOT/examples/ssl-creator.sh.\nThe example creates a client certificate for the user testuser. Furthermore, the server certificate is created for the server name custom-config-ssl.\nThis example can be run as follows for the Docker environment:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/custom-config-ssl ./run.sh  And the example can be run in the following directory for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl ./run.sh  A required step to make this example work is to define in your /etc/hosts file an entry that maps custom-config-ssl to the service IP address for the container.\nFor instance, if your service has an address as follows:\n${CCP_CLI} get service NAME CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE custom-config-ssl 172.30.211.108 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5432/TCP  Then your /etc/hosts file needs an entry like this:\n172.30.211.108 custom-config-ssl  For production Kubernetes and OpenShift installations, it will likely be preferred for DNS names to resolve to the PostgreSQL service name and generate server certificates using the DNS names instead of the example name custom-config-ssl.\nIf as a client it\u0026rsquo;s required to confirm the identity of the server, verify-full can be specified for ssl-mode in the connection string. This will check if the server and the server certificate have the same name. Additionally, the proper connection parameters must be specified in the connection string for the certificate information required to trust and verify the identity of the server (sslrootcert and sslcrl), and to authenticate the client using a certificate (sslcert and sslkey):\npsql \u0026quot;postgresql://testuser@custom-config-ssl:5432/userdb?\\ sslmode=verify-full\u0026amp;\\ sslrootcert=$CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl/certs/ca.crt\u0026amp;\\ sslcrl=$CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl/certs/ca.crl\u0026amp;\\ sslcert=$CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl/certs/client.crt\u0026amp;\\ sslkey=$CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl/certs/client.key\u0026quot;  To connect via IP, sslmode can be changed to require. This will verify the server by checking the certificate chain up to the trusted certificate authority, but will not verify that the hostname matches the certificate, as occurs with verify-full. The same connection parameters as above can be then provided for the client and server certificate information.\npsql \u0026quot;postgresql://testuser@IP_OF_PGSQL:5432/userdb?\\ sslmode=require\u0026amp;\\ sslrootcert=$CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl/certs/ca.crt\u0026amp;\\ sslcrl=$CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl/certs/ca.crl\u0026amp;\\ sslcert=$CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl/certs/client.crt\u0026amp;\\ sslkey=$CCPROOT/examples/kube/custom-config-ssl/certs/client.key\u0026quot;  You should see a connection that looks like the following:\npsql (11.10) SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off) Type \u0026quot;help\u0026quot; for help. userdb=\u0026gt;  "

	"description": "",
	"content": " pgBackRest Examples Written and maintained by David Steele, pgBackRest is a utility that provides backup and restore functionality for PostgreSQL databases. pgBackRest is available for use within the Crunchy Container Suite, and can therefore be utilized to provide an effective backup and restore solution for any database clusters deployed using the crunchy-postgres or crunchy-postgres-gis containers. The following section will provide an overview of how pgBackRest can be utilized within the Crunchy Container Suite, including examples for enabling and configuring pgBackRest, and then utilizing pgBackRest to backup and restore various PostgreSQL database clusters. For more detailed information about pgBackRest, please visit the official pgBackRest website.\nConfiguration Overview In order to enable pgBackRest within a crunchy-postgres or crunchy-postgres-gis container, environment variable PGBACKREST must be set to true during deployment of the container (PGBACKREST=true). This will setup the proper pgBackRest configuration, ensure any required pgBackRest repositories and directories are created, and will create the proper pgBackRest stanza.\nPlease note that setting PGBACKREST=true is all that is needed to configure and enable pgBackRest within a crunchy-postgres or crunchy-postgres-gis container. When enabled, default environment variables will be set for pgBackRest as follows, unless they are otherwise explicitly defined and provided during deployment of the container:\nexport PGBACKREST_STANZA=\u0026#34;db\u0026#34; export PGBACKREST_PG1_PATH=\u0026#34;/pgdata/${PGDATA_DIR}\u0026#34; export PGBACKREST_REPO1_PATH=\u0026#34;/backrestrepo/${PGDATA_DIR}-backups\u0026#34; export PGBACKREST_LOG_PATH=\u0026#34;/tmp\u0026#34; As shown above, a stanza named db is created by default, using the default values provided for both PGBACKREST_PG1_PATH and PGBACKREST_REPO1_PATH. Variable PGDATA_DIR represents the name of the database cluster\u0026rsquo;s data directory, which will either be the hostname of the container or the value specified for variable PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE during deployment of the container. Please see the crunchy-postgres and/or crunchy-postgres-gis container specifications for additional details.\nWhile setting PGBACKREST to true provides a simple method for enabling pgBackRest within a crunchy-postgres or crunchy-postgres-gis container, pgBackRest is also fully configurable and customizable via the various environment variables supported by pgBackRest. This applies to the crunchy-backrest-restore container as well, which is also configured using pgBackRest environment variables when performing database restores. Therefore, during the deployment of any container container containing pgBackRest (crunchy-postgres, crunchy-postgres-gis or crunchy-backrest-restore), environment variables should be utilized to configure and customize the pgBackRest utility as needed and ensure the desired backup and restore functionality is achieved. For instance, the following environment variables could be specified upon deployment of the crunchy-backrest-restore container in order to perform delta restore to a specific point-in-time:\nPGBACKREST_TYPE=time PITR_TARGET=\u0026#34;2019-10-27 16:53:05.590156+00\u0026#34; PGBACKREST_DELTA=y Database restores can be performed via the crunchy-backrest-restore container, which offers full pgBackRest restore capabilities, such as full, point-in-time and delta restores. Further information and guidance for performing both backups and restores using the Crunchy Container Suite and pgBackRest will be provided in the examples below.\nIn addition to providing the backup and restoration capabilities discussed above, pgBackRest supports the capability to asynchronously push and get write ahead logs (WAL) to and from a WAL archive. To enable asychronous WAL archiving within a crunchy-postgres or crunchy-postgres-gis container, pgBackRest environment variable PGBACKREST_ARCHIVE_ASYNC must be set to \u0026quot;y\u0026quot; during deployment (PGBACKREST_ARCHIVE_ASYNC=y). This will automatically enable WAL archiving within the container if not otherwise explicitly enabled, set the proper pgbackrest archive command within the postgresql.conf configuration file, and ensure the proper spool path has been created.\nIf a spool path is not explicitly provided using environment variable PGBACKREST_SPOOL_PATH, this variable will default as follows:\n# Environment variable XLOGDIR=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; export PGBACKREST_SPOOL_PATH=\u0026#34;/pgdata/${PGDATA_DIR}\u0026#34; # Environment variable XLOGDIR!=true export PGBACKREST_SPOOL_PATH=\u0026#34;/pgwal/${PGDATA_DIR}/spool\u0026#34; As shown above, the default location of the spool path depends on whether or not XLOGDIR=true, with XLOGDIR enabling the storage of WAL to the /pgwal volume within the container. Being that pgBackRest recommends selecting a spool path that is as close to the WAL as possible, this provides a sensible default for the spool directory. However, PGBACKREST_SPOOL_PATH can also be explicitly configured during deployment to any path desired. And once again, PGDATA_DIR represents either the hostname of the container or the value specified for variable PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE.\nThe examples below will demonstrate the pgBackRest backup, restore and asynchronous archiving capabilities described above, while also providing insight into the proper configuration of pgBackBackrest within the Crunchy Container Suite. For more information on these pgBackRest capabilities and associated configuration, please consult the official pgBackRest documentation.\nKubernetes and OpenShift The pgBackRest examples for Kubernetes and OpenShift can be configured to use the PostGIS images by setting the following environment variable when running the examples:\nexport CCP_PG_IMAGE=\u0026#39;-gis\u0026#39; Backup In order to demonstrate the backup and restore capabilities provided by pgBackRest, it is first necessary to deploy a PostgreSQL database, and then create a full backup of that database. This example will therefore deploy a crunchy-postgres or crunchy-postgres-gis container containing a PostgreSQL database, which will then be backed up manually by executing a pgbackrest backup command. Please note that this example serves as a prequisite for the restore examples that follow, and therefore must be run prior to running those examples.\nStart the example as follows:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/backup ./run.sh  This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:\n A deployment named backrest containing a PostgreSQL database with pgBackRest configured A service named backrest for the PostgreSQL database A PV and PVC for the PGDATA directory A PV and PVC for the pgBackRest backups and archives directories  Once the backrest deployment is running, use the pgbackrest info command to verify that pgbackrest has been properly configured and WAL archiving is working properly:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- pgbackrest info \\  --stanza=db \\  --repo1-path=/backrestrepo/backrest-backups pg_pid=126 stanza: db status: error (no valid backups) cipher: none db (current) wal archive min/max (11-1): 000000010000000000000001 / 000000010000000000000003 An output similar to the above indicates that pgBackRest was properly configured upon deployment of the pod, the db stanza has been created, and WAL archiving is working properly. The error next to status is expected being that a backup has not yet been generated.\nNow that we have verified that pgBackRest is properly configured and enabled, a backup of the database can be generated. Being that this is the first backup of the database, we will take create a full backup:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- pgbackrest backup \\  --stanza=db \\  --pg1-path=/pgdata/backrest \\  --repo1-path=/backrestrepo/backrest-backups \\  --log-path=/tmp \\  --type=full pg_pid=138 WARN: option repo1-retention-full is not set, the repository may run out of space HINT: to retain full backups indefinitely (without warning), set option \u0026#39;repo1-retention-full\u0026#39; to the maximum. The warning displayed is expected, since backup retention has not been configured for this example. Assuming no errors are displayed, a full backup has now been successfully created.\nRestore pgBackRest provides numerous methods and strategies for restoring a PostgreSQL database. The following section will demonstrate three forms of database restores that can be accomplished when using pgBackRest with the Crunchy Container Suite:\n Full: restore all database files into an empty PGDATA directory point-in-time Recovery (PITR): restore a database to a specific point-in-time using an empty PGDATA directory Delta: restore a database to a specific point-in-time using an existing PGDATA directory  Full This example will demonstrate a full database restore to an empty PGDATA directory. Please ensure the Backup example is currently running and a full backup has been generated prior to running this example.\nPrior to running the full restore, we will first make a change to the currently running database, which will we will then verify still exists following the restore. Create a simple table in the database as follows:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34;create table backrest_test_table (id int)\u0026#34; CREATE TABLE Now verify that the new table exists:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; id ---- (0 rows) With the table in place, we can now start the full restore as follows:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/full ./run.sh This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:\n A Kubernetes job named backrest-full-restore-job which will perform the restore using the crunchy-backrest-restore container A PV and PVC for the new PGDATA directory that will contain the restored database. The directory will initially be empty, as required pgBackRest when performing a full restore, and will then contain the restored database upon completion of the restore.  Please note that a brand new PV and PVC are created when running the restore to clearly indicate that the database will be restored into an entirely new (i.e. empty) volume as required by pgBackRest. The names of the new PV and PVC are as follows:\n PV: ${CCP_NAMESPACE}-br-new-pgdata PVC: br-new-pgdata  You can verify that the restore has completed successfully by verifying that the Kubernetes job has completed successfully:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} get jobs NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE backrest-full-restore-job 1/1 15s 58s Once the job is complete, the post restore script can then be run, which will create a new deployment named backrest-full-restored containing the restored database:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/full ./post-restore.sh Finally, once the backrest-full-restored deployment is running we can verify that the restore was successful by verifying that the table created prior to the restore still exists:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest restored pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; id ---- (0 rows) Please note that the default behavior of pgBackRest is to recover to the end of the WAL archive stream, which is why the full restore contained all changes made since the initial full backup was taken, including the creation of table backrest_test_table. pgBackRest therefore played the entire WAL archive stream for all changes that occurred up until the restore.\nAs a reminder, please remember to run the cleanup script for the Backup example after running the cleanup script for this example.\nPITR As demonstrated with the full restore above, the default behavior of pgBackRest is to recover to the end of the WAL archive stream. However, pgBackRest also provides the ability to recover to a specific point-in-time utilizing the WAL archives created since the last backup. This example will demonstrate how pgBackRest can be utilized to perform a point-in-time recovery (PITR) and therefore recover the database to specific point-in-time specified by the user. Please ensure that the Backup example is currently running and a full backup has been generated prior to running this example.\nPrior to running the PITR restore, we will first verify the current state of the database, after which we will then make a change to the database. This will allow us to verify that the PITR is successful by providing a method of verifying that the database has been restored to its current state following the restore.\nTo verify the current state of the database, we will first verify that a table called backrest_test_table does not exist in the database.\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34; table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; ERROR: relation \u0026#34;backrest_test_table\u0026#34; does not exist LINE 1: table backrest_test_table ^ command terminated with exit code 1 Next, capture the current timestamp, which will be used later in the example when performing the restore:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34;select current_timestamp\u0026#34; current_timestamp ------------------------------- 2019-10-27 16:53:05.590156+00 (1 row) Now create table backrest_test_table:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34;create table backrest_test_table (id int)\u0026#34; CREATE TABLE Then verify that the new table exists:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; id ---- (0 rows) With the table in place, we can now start the PITR. However, the timestamp captured above must also be provided in order to instruct pgBackRest to recover to that specific point-in-time. This is done using the CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP variable, which allows us to then start the PITR as follows (replace the timestamp in the command below with the timestamp you captured above):\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/pitr CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP=\u0026#34;2019-10-27 16:53:05.590156+00\u0026#34; ./run.sh This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment: - A Kubernetes job named backrest-pitr-restore-job which will perform the restore using the crunchy-backrest-restore container\nAdditionally, when this example is run, the following pgBackRest environment variables are provided to the crunchy-backrest-restore container in order to initiate PITR restore to the point-in-time specified by the timestamp (in additional to any other pgBackRest variables required by the Crunchy Container Suite and pgBackRest):\nPGBACKREST_TYPE=time PITR_TARGET=\u0026#34;${CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP}\u0026#34; As can be seen above, the timestamp provided for CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP is used to populate variable PITR_TARGET, and therefore specify the point-in-time to restore the database to, while PGBACKREST_TYPE is set to time to indicate that a PITR should be performed.\nPlease note that the following pgBackRest environment variable is also set when performing the PITR, which results in a restore to a new/empty directory within an existing PV:\nPGBACKREST_PG1_PATH=/pgdata/backrest-pitr-restored You can verify that the restore has completed successfully by verifying that the Kubernetes job has completed successfully:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} get jobs NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE backrest-pitr-restore-job 1/1 15s 58s Once the job is complete, the post restore script can then be run, which will create a new deployment named backrest-pitr-restored containing the restored database:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/pitr ./post-restore.sh Finally, once the backrest-pitr-restored deployment is running we can verify that the restore was successful by verifying that the table created prior to the restore no longer exists:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest restored pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34; table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; ERROR: relation \u0026#34;backrest_test_table\u0026#34; does not exist LINE 1: table backrest_test_table ^ command terminated with exit code 1 As a reminder, please remember to run the cleanup script for the Backup example after running the cleanup script for this example.\nDelta By default, pgBackRest requires a clean/empty directory in order to perform a restore. However, pgBackRest also provides an another option when performing the restore in the form of the delta option, which allows the restore to be run against an existing PGDATA directory. With the delta option enabled, pgBackRest will use checksums to determine which files in the directory can be preserved, and which need to be restored (please note that pgBackRest will also remove any files that are not present in the backup). This example will again demonstrate a point-in-time recovery (PITR), only this time the restore will occur within the existing PGDATA directory by specifying the delta option during the restore. Please ensure that the Backup example is currently running and a full backup has been generated prior to running this example.\nPrior to running the delta restore, we will first verify the current state of the database, and we will then make a change to the database. This will allow us to verify that the delta restore is successful by providing a method of verifying that the database has been restored to its current state following the restore.\nTo verify the current state of the database, we will first verify that a table called backrest_test_table does not exist in the database.\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34; table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; ERROR: relation \u0026#34;backrest_test_table\u0026#34; does not exist LINE 1: table backrest_test_table ^ command terminated with exit code 1 Next, capture the current timestamp, which will be used later in the example when performing the restore:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34;select current_timestamp\u0026#34; current_timestamp ------------------------------- 2019-10-27 16:53:05.590156+00 (1 row) Now create table backrest_test_table:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34;create table backrest_test_table (id int)\u0026#34; CREATE TABLE Then verify that the new table exists:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; id ---- (0 rows) With the table in place, we can now start the delta restore. When running the restore example the timestamp captured above must also be provided in order to instruct pgBackRest to recover to that specific point-in-time. This is done using the CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP variable, which allows us to then start the delta restore as follows (replace the timestamp in the command below with the timestamp you captured above):\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/delta CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP=\u0026#34;2019-10-27 16:53:05.590156+00\u0026#34; ./run.sh This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment: - A Kubernetes job named backrest-delta-restore-job which will perform the restore using the crunchy-backrest-restore container\nAdditionally, when this example is run, the following pgBackRest environment variables are provided to the crunchy-backrest-restore container in order to initiate a delta restore to the point-in-time specified by the timestamp (in additional to any other pgBackRest variables required by the Crunchy Container Suite and pgBackRest):\nPGBACKREST_TYPE=time PITR_TARGET=\u0026#34;${CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP}\u0026#34; PGBACKREST_DELTA=y As can be seen above, the timestamp provided for CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP is used to populate variable PITR_TARGET, and therefore specify the point-in-time to restore to, while PGBACKREST_TYPE is set to time to indicate that a PITR should be performed. PGBACKREST_DELTA is set to y to indicate that the delta option should be utilized when performing the restore.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that the following pgBackRest environment variable is also set when performing the delta restore, which results in a restore within the existing PGDATA directory utilized by the database deployed when running the Backup example:\nPGBACKREST_PG1_PATH=/pgdata/backrest You can then verify that the restore has completed successfully by verifying that the Kubernetes job has completed successfully:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} get jobs NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE backrest-delta-restore-job 1/1 15s 58s Once the job is complete, the post restore script can then be run, which will create a new deployment named backrest-delta-restored containing the restored database:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/delta ./post-restore.sh Finally, once the backrest-delta-restored deployment is running we can verify that the restore was successful by verifying that the table created prior to the restore no longer exists:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest restored pod name\u0026gt; -- psql -c \u0026#34; table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; ERROR: relation \u0026#34;backrest_test_table\u0026#34; does not exist LINE 1: table backrest_test_table ^ command terminated with exit code 1 As a reminder, please remember to run the cleanup script for the Backup example after running the cleanup script for this example.\nAsync Archiving pgBackRest supports the capability to asynchronously push and get write ahead logs (WAL) to and from a WAL archive. Asynchronous archiving can improve performance by parallelizing operations, while also reducing the number of connections to remote storage. For more information on async archiving and its benefits, please see the official pgBackRest documentation. This example will demonstrate how asynchronous archiving can be enabled within a crunchy-postgres or crunchy-postgres-gis container, while then also demonstrating the creation of a differential backup.\nStart the example as follows:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest/async-archiving ./run.sh  This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment: - A deployment named backrest-async-archive containing a PostgreSQL database with pgBackRest configured - A service named backrest-async-archive for the PostgreSQL database - A PV and PVC for the PGDATA directory - A PV and PVC for the pgBackRest backups and archives directories\nAdditionally, the following variable will be set during deployment of the pod in order to enable asynchronous archiving:\nPGBACKREST_ARCHIVE_ASYNC=y This will also result in the creation of the required spool path, which we can see by listing the contents of the /pgdata directory in the backrest-async-archive deployment:\n$ ${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest async archive pod name\u0026gt; -- ls /pgdata backrest-async-archive backrest-async-archive-backups backrest-async-archive-spool Once the database is up an running, a full backup can be taken:\n${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest async archive pod name\u0026gt; -- pgbackrest backup \\  --stanza=db \\  --pg1-path=/pgdata/backrest-async-archive \\  --repo1-path=/backrestrepo/backrest-async-archive-backups \\  --log-path=/tmp \\  --type=full And once a full backup has been taken, other types of backups can also be taken using pgBackRest, such as a differential backup:\n${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest async archive pod name\u0026gt; -- pgbackrest backup \\  --stanza=db \\  --pg1-path=/pgdata/backrest-async-archive \\  --repo1-path=/backrestrepo/backrest-async-archive-backups \\  --log-path=/tmp \\  --type=diff The following command can then be run to verify that both backups were created successfully:\n${CCP_CLI} exec \u0026lt;backrest async archive pod name\u0026gt; -- pgbackrest info \\  --stanza=db \\  --repo1-path=/backrestrepo/backrest-async-archive-backups Docker Backup In order to demonstrate the backup and restore capabilities provided by pgBackRest, it is first necessary to deploy a PostgreSQL database, and then create a full backup of that database. This example will therefore deploy a crunchy-postgres or crunchy-postgres-gis container containing a PostgreSQL database, which will then be backed up manually by executing a pgbackrest backup command. Please note that this example serves as a prequisite for the restore examples that follow, and therefore must be run prior to running those examples.\nStart the example as follows:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backrest/backup ./run.sh  This will create the following in your Docker environment: - A container named backrest containing a PostgreSQL database with pgBackRest configured - A volume for the PGDATA directory - A volume for the pgBackRest backups and archives directories\nOnce the backrest container is running, use the pgbackrest info command to verify that pgbackrest has been properly configured and WAL archiving is working properly:\n$ docker exec backrest pgbackrest info \\  --stanza=db \\  --repo1-path=/backrestrepo/backrest-backups pg_pid=126 stanza: db status: error (no valid backups) cipher: none db (current) wal archive min/max (11-1): 000000010000000000000001 / 000000010000000000000003 An output similar to the above indicates that pgBackRest was properly configured upon deployment of the container, the db stanza has been created, and WAL archiving is working properly. The error next to status is expected being that a backup has not yet been generated.\nNow that we have verified that pgBackRest is properly configured and enabled, a backup of the database can be generated. Being that this is the first backup of the database, we will take create a full backup:\n$ docker exec backrest pgbackrest backup \\  --stanza=db \\  --pg1-path=/pgdata/backrest \\  --repo1-path=/backrestrepo/backrest-backups \\  --log-path=/tmp \\  --type=full pg_pid=138 WARN: option repo1-retention-full is not set, the repository may run out of space HINT: to retain full backups indefinitely (without warning), set option \u0026#39;repo1-retention-full\u0026#39; to the maximum. The warning displayed is expected, since backup retention has not been configured for this example. Assuming no errors are displayed, a full backup has now been successfully created.\nRestore pgBackRest provides numerous methods and strategies for restoring a PostgreSQL database. The following section will demonstrate three forms of database restores that can be accomplished when using pgBackRest with the Crunchy Container Suite: - Full: restore all database files into an empty PGDATA directory - point-in-time Recovery (PITR): restore a database to a specific point-in-time using an empty PGDATA directory - Delta: restore a database to a specific point-in-time using an existing PGDATA directory\nFull This example will demonstrate a full database restore to an empty PGDATA directory. Please ensure the Backup example is currently running and a full backup has been generated prior to running this example.\nPrior to running the full restore, we will first make a change to the currently running database, which will we will then verify still exists following the restore. Create a simple table in the database as follows:\n$ docker exec backrest psql -c \u0026#34;create table backrest_test_table (id int)\u0026#34; CREATE TABLE Now verify that the new table exists:\n$ docker exec backrest psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; id ---- (0 rows) With the table in place, we can now start the full restore as follows:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backrest/full ./run.sh This will create the following in your Docker environment: - A container named backrest-full-restore which will perform the restore using the crunchy-backrest-restore container - A volume for the new PGDATA directory that will contain the restored database. The directory will initially be empty, as required pgBackRest when performing a full restore, and will then contain the restored database upon completion of the restore.\nPlease note that a brand new PV and PVC are created when running the restore to clearly indicate that the database will be restored into an entirely new (i.e. empty) volume as required by pgBackRest. The names of the new PV and PVC are as follows: - PV: ${CCP_NAMESPACE}-br-new-pgdata - PVC: br-new-pgdata\nYou can verify that the restore has completed successfully by verifying that the container has finished running and has exited without errors:\ndocker ps -a Once the container has finished running, the post restore script can then be run, which will create a new container named backrest-full-restored containing the restored database:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backrest/full ./post-restore.sh Finally, once the backrest-full-restored container is running we can verify that the restore was successful by verifying that the table created prior to the restore still exists:\n$ docker exec backrest-full-restored psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; id ---- (0 rows) Please note that the default behavior of pgBackRest is to recover to the end of the WAL archive stream, which is why the full restore contained all changes made since the initial full backup was taken, including the creation of table backrest_test_table. pgBackRest therefore played the entire WAL archive stream for all changes that occurred up until the restore.\nAs a reminder, please remember to run the cleanup script for the Backup example after running the cleanup script for this example.\nPITR As demonstrated with the full restore above, the default behavior of pgBackRest is to recover to the end of the WAL archive stream. However, pgBackRest also provides the ability to recover to a specific point-in-time utilizing the WAL archives created since the last backup. This example will demonstrate how pgBackRest can be utilized to perform a point-in-time recovery (PITR) and therefore recover the database to specific point-in-time specified by the user. Please ensure that the Backup example is currently running and a full backup has been generated prior to running this example.\nPrior to running the PITR restore, we will first verify the current state of the database, after which we will then make a change to the database. This will allow us to verify that the PITR is successful by providing a method of verifying that the database has been restored to its current state following the restore.\nTo verify the current state of the database, we will first verify that a table called backrest_test_table does not exist in the database.\n$ docker exec backrest psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; ERROR: relation \u0026#34;backrest_test_table\u0026#34; does not exist LINE 1: table backrest_test_table ^ command terminated with exit code 1 Next, capture the current timestamp, which will be used later in the example when performing the restore:\n$ docker exec backrest psql -c \u0026#34;select current_timestamp\u0026#34; current_timestamp ------------------------------- 2019-10-27 16:53:05.590156+00 (1 row) Now create table backrest_test_table:\n$ docker exec backrest psql -c \u0026#34;create table backrest_test_table (id int)\u0026#34; CREATE TABLE Then verify that the new table exists:\n$ docker exec backrest psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; id ---- (0 rows) With the table in place, we can now start the PITR. However, the timestamp captured above must also be provided in order to instruct pgBackRest to recover to that specific point-in-time. This is done using the CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP variable, which allows us to then start the PITR as follows (replace the timestamp in the command below with the timestamp you captured above):\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backrest/pitr CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP=\u0026#34;2019-10-27 16:53:05.590156+00\u0026#34; ./run.sh This will create the following in your Docker environment: - A container named backrest-pitr-restore which will perform the restore using the crunchy-backrest-restore container\nAdditionally, when this example is run, the following pgBackRest environment variables are provided to the crunchy-backrest-restore container in order to initiate PITR to the point-in-time specified by the timestamp (in additional to any other pgBackRest variables required by the Crunchy Container Suite and pgBackRest):\nPGBACKREST_TYPE=time PITR_TARGET=\u0026#34;${CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP}\u0026#34; As can be seen above, the timestamp provided for CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP is used to populate variable PITR_TARGET, and therefore specify the point-in-time to restore the database to, while PGBACKREST_TYPE is set to time to indicate that a PITR should be performed.\nPlease note that the following pgBackRest environment variable is also set when performing the PITR, which results in a restore to a new/empty directory within an existing PV:\nPGBACKREST_PG1_PATH=/pgdata/backrest-pitr-restored You can verify that the restore has completed successfully by verifying that the container has finished running and has exited without errors:\ndocker ps -a Once the container has finished running, the post restore script can then be run, which will create a new container named backrest-pitr-restored containing the restored database:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backrest/pitr ./post-restore.sh Finally, once the backrest-pitr-restored container is running we can verify that the restore was successful by verifying that the table created prior to the restore no longer exists:\n$ docker exec backrest-pitr-restored psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; ERROR: relation \u0026#34;backrest_test_table\u0026#34; does not exist LINE 1: table backrest_test_table ^ command terminated with exit code 1 As a reminder, please remember to run the cleanup script for the Backup example after running the cleanup script for this example.\nDelta By default, pgBackRest requires a clean/empty directory in order to perform a restore. However, pgBackRest also provides an another option when performing the restore in the form of the delta option, which allows the restore to be run against an existing PGDATA directory. With the delta option enabled, pgBackRest will use checksums to determine which files in the directory can be preserved, and which need to be restored (please note that pgBackRest will also remove any files that are not present in the backup). This example will again demonstrate a point-in-time recovery (PITR), only this time the restore will occur within the existing PGDATA directory by specifying the delta option during the restore. Please ensure that the Backup example is currently running and a full backup has been generated prior to running this example.\nPrior to running the delta restore, we will first verify the current state of the database, and we will then make a change to the database. This will allow us to verify that the delta restore is successful by providing a method of verifying that the database has been restored to its current state following the restore.\nTo verify the current state of the database, we will first verify that a table called backrest_test_table does not exist in the database.\n$ docker exec backrest psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; ERROR: relation \u0026#34;backrest_test_table\u0026#34; does not exist LINE 1: table backrest_test_table ^ command terminated with exit code 1 Next, capture the current timestamp, which will be used later in the example when performing the restore:\n$ docker exec backrest psql -c \u0026#34;select current_timestamp\u0026#34; current_timestamp ------------------------------- 2019-10-27 16:53:05.590156+00 (1 row) Now create table backrest_test_table:\n$ docker exec backrest psql -c \u0026#34;create table backrest_test_table (id int)\u0026#34; CREATE TABLE Then verify that the new table exists:\n$ docker exec backrest psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; id ---- (0 rows) With the table in place, we can now start the delta restore. When running the restore example the timestamp captured above must also be provided in order to instruct pgBackRest to recover to that specific point-in-time. This is done using the CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP variable, which allows us to then start the delta restore as follows (replace the timestamp in the command below with the timestamp you captured above):\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backrest/delta CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP=\u0026#34;2019-10-27 16:53:05.590156+00\u0026#34; ./run.sh This will create the following in your Docker environment: - A container named backrest-delta-restore which will perform the restore using the crunchy-backrest-restore container\nAdditionally, when this example is run, the following pgBackRest environment variables are provided to the crunchy-backrest-restore container in order to initiate a delta restore to the point-in-time specified by the timestamp (in additional to any other pgBackRest variables required by the Crunchy Container Suite and pgBackRest):\nPGBACKREST_TYPE=time PITR_TARGET=\u0026#34;${CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP}\u0026#34; PGBACKREST_DELTA=y As can be seen above, the timestamp provided for CCP_BACKREST_TIMESTAMP is used to populate variable PITR_TARGET, and therefore specify the point-in-time to restore to, while PGBACKREST_TYPE is set to time to indicate that a PITR should be performed. PGBACKREST_DELTA is set to y to indicate that the delta option should be utilized when performing the restore.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that the following pgBackRest environment variable is also set when performing the delta restore, which results in a restore within the existing PGDATA directory utilized by the database deployed when running the Backup example:\nPGBACKREST_PG1_PATH=/pgdata/backrest You can verify that the restore has completed successfully by verifying that the container has finished running and has exited without errors:\ndocker ps -a Once the container has finished running, the post restore script can then be run, which will create a new container named backrest-delta-restored containing the restored database:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backrest/delta ./post-restore.sh Finally, once the backrest-delta-restored container is running we can verify that the restore was successful by verifying that the table created prior to the restore no longer exists:\n$ docker exec backrest-delta-restored psql -c \u0026#34;table backrest_test_table\u0026#34; ERROR: relation \u0026#34;backrest_test_table\u0026#34; does not exist LINE 1: table backrest_test_table ^ command terminated with exit code 1 As a reminder, please remember to run the cleanup script for the Backup example after running the cleanup script for this example.\nAsync Archiving pgBackRest supports the capability to asynchronously push and get write ahead logs (WAL) to and from a WAL archive. Asynchronous archiving can improve performance by parallelizing operations, while also reducing the number of connections to remote storage. For more information on async archiving and its benefits, please see the official pgBackRest documentation. This example will demonstrate how asynchronous archiving can be enabled within a crunchy-postgres or crunchy-postgres-gis container, while then also demonstrating the creation of a differential backup.\nStart the example as follows:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/backrest/async-archive ./run.sh  This will create the following in your Docker environment:\n A container named backrest-async-archive containing a PostgreSQL database with pgBackRest configured A volume for the PGDATA directory A volume for the pgBackRest backups and archives directories  Additionally, the following variable will be set during deployment of the container in order to enable asynchronous archiving:\nPGBACKREST_ARCHIVE_ASYNC=y This will also result in the creation of the required spool path, which we can see by listing the contents of the /pgdata directory in the backrest-async-archive container:\n$ docker exec backrest-async-archive ls /pgdata backrest-async-archive backrest-async-archive-backups backrest-async-archive-spool Once the database is up an running, a full backup can be taken:\ndocker exec backrest-async-archive pgbackrest backup \\  --stanza=db \\  --pg1-path=/pgdata/backrest-async-archive \\  --repo1-path=/backrestrepo/backrest-async-archive-backups \\  --log-path=/tmp \\  --type=full And once a full backup has been taken, other types of backups can also be taken using pgBackRest, such as a differential backup:\ndocker exec backrest-async-archive pgbackrest backup \\  --stanza=db \\  --pg1-path=/pgdata/backrest-async-archive \\  --repo1-path=/backrestrepo/backrest-async-archive-backups \\  --log-path=/tmp \\  --type=diff The following command can then be run to verify that both backups were created successfully:\ndocker exec backrest-async-archive pgbackrest info \\  --stanza=db \\  --repo1-path=/backrestrepo/backrest-async-archive-backups"

This includes guidance for standing-up and configuring your environment in order to run Crunchy Containers examples that can be found in the next section.\nPlease see the following sections in order to properly setup and configure your environment for the Crunchy Container Suite (please feel free to skip any sections that have already been completed within your environment):\n Platform Installation Crunchy Container Suite Installation Storage Configuration Example Guidance  Once your environment has been configured according to instructions provided above, you will be able to run the Crunchy Container Suite examples. These examples will demonstrate the various capabilities provided by the Crunchy Container Suite, including how to properly configure and deploy the various containers within the suite, and then utilize the features and services provided by those containers. The examples therefore demonstrate how the Crunchy Container Suite can be utilized to effectively deploy a PostgreSQL database cluster within your own environment, that meets your specific needs and contains the PostgreSQL features and services that you require.\nPlatform Installation In order to run the examples and deploy various containers within the Crunchy Container Suite, you will first need access to an environment containing one of the following supported platforms:\n Docker 1.13+ (https://www.docker.com/) Kubernetes 1.8+ (https://kubernetes.io/) OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 (https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform/)  Links to the official website for each of these platform are provided above. Please consult the official documentation for instructions on how to install and configure these platforms in your environment.\nCrunchy Container Suite Installation Once you have access to an environment containing one of the supported platforms, it is then necessary to properly configure that environment in order to run the examples, and therefore deploy the various containers included in the Crunchy Container Suite. This can be done by following the Crunchy Container Suite Installation Guide.\nPlease note that as indicated within the Installation Guide, certain steps may require administrative access and/or privileges. Therefore, please work with your local System Administrator(s) as needed to setup and configure your environment according to the steps defined within this guide. Additionally, certain steps are only applicable to certain platforms and/or environments, so please be sure to follow all instructions that are applicable to your target environment.\nStorage Configuration Once you have completed all applicable steps in the Installation Guide, you can then proceed with configuring storage in your environment. The specific forms of storage supported by the Crunchy Containers Suite, as well as instructions for configuring and enabling those forms of storage, can be found in the Storage Configuration guide. Therefore, please review and follow steps in the Storage Configuration guide in order to properly configure storage in your environment according to your specific storage needs.\nExample Guidance With the Installation Guide and Storage Configuration complete, you are almost ready to run the examples. However, prior to doing so it is recommended that you first review the documentation for Running the Examples, which describes various conventions utilized in the examples, while also providing any other information, resources and guidance relevant to successfully running the Crunchy Container Suite examples in your environment.

	"content": " Running the Examples The Kubernetes and OpenShift examples in this guide have been designed using single-node Kubernetes/OCP clusters whose host machines provide any required supporting infrastructure or services (e.g. local HostPath storage or access to an NFS share). Therefore, for the best results when running these examples, it is recommended that you utilize a single-node architecture as well.\nAdditionally, the examples located in the kube directory work on both Kubernetes and OpenShift. Please ensure the CCP_CLI environment variable is set to the correct binary for your environment, as shown below:\n# Kubernetes export CCP_CLI=kubectl # OpenShift export CCP_CLI=oc NOTE: Set the CCP_CLI environment variable in .bashrc to ensure the examples will work properly in your environment\nExample Conventions The examples provided in Crunchy Container Suite are simple examples that are meant to demonstrate key Crunchy Container Suite features. These examples can be used to build more production level deployments as dictated by user requirements specific to their operating environments.\nThe examples generally follow these conventions: - There is a run.sh script that you will execute to start the example - There is a cleanup.sh script that you will execute to shutdown and cleanup the example - Each example will create resources such as Secrets, ConfigMaps, Services, and PersistentVolumeClaims, all which follow a naming convention of \u0026lt;example name\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;optional description suffix\u0026gt;. For example, an example called primary might have a PersistentVolumeClaim called primary-pgconf to describe the purpose of that particular PVC. - The folder names for each example give a clue as to which Container Suite feature it demonstrates. For instance, the examples/kube/pgaudit example demonstrates how to enable the pg_audit capability in the crunchy-postgres container.\nHelpful Resources Here are some useful resources for finding the right commands to troubleshoot and modify containers in the various environments shown in this guide:\n Docker Cheat Sheet Kubectl Cheat Sheet OpenShift Cheat Sheet Helm Cheat Sheet  Crunchy Container Suite Examples Now that your environment has been properly configured for the Crunchy Container Suite and you have reviewed the guidance for running the examples, you are ready to run the Crunchy Container Suite examples.

It runs the same sequence of SQL commands over and over, possibly in multiple concurrent database sessions, and then calculates the average transaction rate (transactions per second). By default, pgbench tests a scenario that is loosely based on TPC-B, involving five SELECT, UPDATE, and INSERT commands per transaction. However, it is easy to test other cases by writing your own transaction script files.\nFor more information on how to configure this container, please see the Container Specifications document.\nDocker This example requires the primary example to be running.

	"description": "",
	"content": " Centralized Logging Example The logs generated by containers are critical for deployments because they provide insights into the health of the system. PostgreSQL logs are very detailed and there is some information that can only be obtained from logs (but not limited to):\n Connections and Disconnections of users Checkpoint Statistics PostgreSQL Server Errors  Aggregrating container logs across multiple hosts allows administrators to audit, debug problems and prevent repudiation of misconduct.\nIn the following example we will demonstrate how to setup Kubernetes and OpenShift to use centralized logging by using an EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana) stack. Fluentd will run as a daemonset on each host within the Kubernetes cluster and extract container logs, Elasticsearch will consume and index the logs gathered by Fluentd and Kibana will allow users to explore and visualize the logs via a web dashboard.\nTo learn more about the EFK stack, see the following:\n https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch https://www.fluentd.org/architecture https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana  Configure PostgreSQL for Centralized Logging By default, Crunchy PostgreSQL logs to files in the /pgdata directory. In order to get the logs out of the container we need to configure PostgreSQL to log to stdout.\nThe following settings should be configured in postgresql.conf to make PostgreSQL log to stdout:\nlog_destination = 'stderr' logging_collector = off  Changes to logging settings require a restart of the PostgreSQL container to take effect.  Deploying the EFK Stack On OpenShift Container Platform OpenShift Container Platform can be installed with an EFK stack. For more information about configuring OpenShift to create an EFK stack, see the official documentation:\n https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/aggregate_logging.html  Deploying the EFK Stack On Kubernetes First, deploy the EFK stack by running the example using the following commands:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/centralized-logging/efk ./run.sh  Elasticsearch is configured to use an `emptyDir` volume in this example. Configure this example to provide a persistent volume when deploying into production.  Next, verify the pods are running in the kube-system namespace:\n${CCP_CLI?} get pods -n kube-system --selector=k8s-app=elasticsearch-logging ${CCP_CLI?} get pods -n kube-system --selector=k8s-app=fluentd-es ${CCP_CLI?} get pods -n kube-system --selector=k8s-app=kibana-logging  If all pods deployed successfully, Elasticsearch should already be receiving container logs from Fluentd.\nNext we will deploy a PostgreSQL Cluster (primary and replica deployments) to demonstrate PostgreSQL logs are being captured by Fluentd.\nDeploy the PostgreSQL cluster by running the following:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/centralized-logging/postgres-cluster ./run.sh  Next, verify the pods are running:\n${CCP_CLI?} get pods --selector=k8s-app=postgres-cluster  With the PostgreSQL successfully deployed, we can now query the logs in Kibana.\nWe will need to setup a port-forward to the Kibana pod to access it. To do that we first get the name of the pod by running the following command:\n${CCP_CLI?} get pod --selector=k8s-app=kibana-logging -n kube-system  Next, start the port-forward:\n${CCP_CLI?} port-forward \u0026lt;KIBANA POD NAME\u0026gt; 5601:5601 -n kube-system  To access the web dashboard navigate in a browser to 127.0.0.1:5601.\nFirst, click the Discover tab and setup an index pattern to use for queries.\nThe index pattern name we will use is logstash-* because Fluentd is configured to generate logstash style logs.\nNext we will configure the Time Filter field name to be @timestamp.\nNow that our index pattern is created, we can query for the container logs.\nClick the Discover tab and use the following queries:\n# KUBERNETES CONTAINER_NAME: *primary* AND MESSAGE: \u0026quot;.*LOG*\u0026quot; # OpenShift kubernetes.pod_name: \u0026quot;primary\u0026quot; AND log  For more information about querying Kibana, see the official documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/kibana-queries-filters.html\nTo delete the centralized logging example run the following:\n${CCP_ROOT?}/examples/kube/centralized-logging/efk/cleanup.sh  To delete the cluster roles required by the EFK stack, as an administrator, run the following:\n${CCP_ROOT?}/examples/kube/centralized-logging/efk/cleanup-rbac.sh  "

If you choose to configure pg_audit via a postgresql.conf file, then you will need to define your own custom file and mount it to override the default postgresql.conf file.\nDocker Run the following to create a database container:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/pgaudit ./run.sh  This starts an instance of the pg_audit container (running crunchy-postgres) on port 12005 on localhost. The test script is then automatically executed.\nThis test executes a SQL file which contains pg_audit configuration statements as well as executes some basic SQL commands. These SQL commands will cause pg_audit to create log messages in the pg_log log file created by the database container.\nKubernetes and OpenShift Run the following:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgaudit ./run.sh  This script will create a PostgreSQL pod with the pgAudit extension configured and ready to use\nOnce the pod is deployed successfully run the following command to test the extension:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/pgaudit ./test-pgaudit.sh  This example has been configured to log directly to stdout of the pod.

It does not do multi-version upgrades so you will need to for example do a 10 to 11 and then a 11 to 12 to get to version 12.\nPrior to running this example, make sure your CCP_IMAGE_TAG environment variable is using the next major version of PostgreSQL that you want to upgrade to. For example, if you\u0026rsquo;re upgrading from 12 to 13, make sure the variable references a PostgreSQL 13 image such as ubi8-13.8-4.7.7.\nThis will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:\n a Kubernetes Job running the crunchy-upgrade container a new data directory name upgrade found in the pgnewdata PVC  Data checksums on the Crunchy PostgreSQL container were enabled by default in version 2.1.0. When trying to upgrade, it's required that both the old database and the new database have the same data checksums setting. Prior to upgrade, check if `data_checksums` were enabled on the database by running the following SQL: `SHOW data_checksums`  Kubernetes and OpenShift Before running the example, ensure you edit `upgrade.json` and update the `OLD_VERSION` and `NEW_VERSION` parameters to the major release version relevant to your situation.  First, delete the existing primary deployment:\n${CCP_CLI} delete deployment primary  Then start the upgrade as follows:\ncd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/upgrade ./run.sh  If successful, the Job will end with a successful status. Verify the results of the Job by examining the Job\u0026rsquo;s pod log:\n${CCP_CLI} get pod -l job-name=upgrade ${CCP_CLI} logs -l job-name=upgrade  You can verify the upgraded database by running the post-upgrade.sh script in the examples/kube/upgrade directory.

	"description": "",
	"content": " Overview This document serves four purposes:\n Ensure you have the prerequisites for building the images in Crunchy Container Suite Make sure your local machine has all the pieces needed to run the examples in the GitHub repository Run the images as standalone containers in Docker Instruct you how to install the Crunchy Container Suite into Kubernetes or OpenShift  Where applicable, we will try to denote which installations and steps are required for the items above.\nWhen we set up the directories below, you will notice they seem to be quite deeply nested. We are setting up a Go programming language workspace. Go has a specific folder structure for it\u0026rsquo;s workspaces with multiple projects in a workspace. If you are not going build the container images you can ignore the deep directories below, but it will not hurt you if you follow the directions exactly.\nRequirements These instructions are developed and on for the following operating systems:\n CentOS 7\n RHEL 7\n  We also assume you are using the Docker provided with the distributions above. If you have installed Docker CE or EE on your machine, please create a VM for this work or uninstall Docker CE or EE.\nThe images in Crunchy Container Suite can run on different environments including:\n Docker 1.13+\n OpenShift Container Platform 3.11\n Kubernetes 1.8+\n  Initial Installs Please note that _golang_ is only required if you are building the containers from source. If you do not plan on building the containers then installing _git_ is sufficient.  CentOS 7 only $ sudo yum -y install epel-release $ sudo yum -y install golang git  RHEL 7 only $ sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=\u0026quot;rhel-7-server-extras-rpms\u0026quot; --enable=\u0026quot;rhel-7-server-optional-rpms\u0026quot; $ sudo yum -y install epel-release $ sudo yum -y install golang git  Clone GitHub repository Make directories to hold the GitHub clone that also work with the Go workspace structure\n$ mkdir -p $HOME/cdev/src/github.com/crunchydata $HOME/cdev/pkg $HOME/cdev/bin $ cd $HOME/cdev/src/github.com/crunchydata $ git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers $ cd crunchy-containers $ git checkout v4.7.7  Your Shell Environment We have found, that because of the way Go handles different projects, you may want to create a separate account if are plan to build the containers and work on other Go projects. You could also look into some of the GOPATH wrappers.\nIf your goal is to simply run the containers, any properly configured user account should work.\nNow we need to set the project paths and software version numbers. Edit your $HOME/.bashrc file with your favorite editor and add the following information. You can leave out the comments at the end of each line starting with #:\nexport GOPATH=$HOME/cdev # set path to your new Go workspace export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin # set bin path export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN # add Go bin path to your overall path export CCP_BASEOS=ubi8 # centos7 for CentOS, ubi8 for Red Hat Universal Base Image export CCP_PGVERSION=13 # The PostgreSQL major version export CCP_PG_FULLVERSION=13.8 export CCP_POSTGIS_VERSION=3.1 # The PostGIS version export CCP_VERSION=4.7.7 export CCP_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata # Prefix to put before all the container image names export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PG_FULLVERSION-$CCP_VERSION # Used to tag the images export CCP_POSTGIS_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PG_FULLVERSION-$CCP_POSTGIS_VERSION-$CCP_VERSION # Used to tag images that include PostGIS export CCPROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers # The base of the clone github repo export CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; export CCP_CLI=kubectl # kubectl for K8s, oc for OpenShift export CCP_NAMESPACE=demo # Change this to whatever namespace/openshift project name you want to use  It will be necessary to refresh your .bashrc file in order for the changes to take effect.\n. ~/.bashrc  At this point we have almost all the prequesites required to build the Crunchy Container Suite.\nBuilding UBI Containers With Supported Crunchy Enterprise Software Before you can build supported containers on UBI and Crunchy Supported Software, you need to add the Crunchy repositories to your approved Yum repositories. Crunchy Enterprise Customer running on UBI can login and download the Crunchy repository key and yum repository from https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads page. Once the files are downloaded please place them into the $CCPROOT/conf directory (defined above in the environment variable section).\nInstall Docker The OpenShift and Kubernetes (KubeAdm) instructions both have a section for installing docker. Installing docker now won't cause any issues but you may wish to configure Docker storage before bringing everything up. Configuring Docker Storage is different from *Storage Configuration* referenced later in the instructions and is not covered here. For a basic docker installation, you can follow the instructions below. Please refer to the respective installation guide for the version of Kubernetes you are installing for more specific details.  Install Docker\nsudo yum -y install docker  It is necessary to add the docker group and give your user access to that group:\nsudo groupadd docker sudo usermod -a -G docker \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;  Logout and login again as the same user to allow group settings to take effect.\nEnable Docker service and start Docker (once all configuration is complete):\nsudo systemctl enable docker.service sudo systemctl start docker.service  At this point you should be able to build the containers. Please to go to [Building the Containers](/contributing/building/) page and continue from there.  Install PostgreSQL You only need to install PostgreSQL locally if you want to use the examples - it is not required for either building the containers or installing the containers into Kubernetes.  There are a variety of ways you can download PostgreSQL.\nFor specific installation instructions for installing PostgreSQL 12 on CentOS, please visit the Crunchy Data Developer Portal:\nhttps://www.crunchydata.com/developers/download-postgres/binaries/postgresql12\nConfiguring Storage for Kubernetes Based Systems In addition to the environment variables we set earlier, you will need to add environment variables for Kubernetes storage configuration. Please see the Storage Configuration document for configuring storage using environment variables set in .bashrc.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to:\nsource ~/.bashrc  OpenShift Installation Use the OpenShift installation guide to install OpenShift Enterprise on your host. Make sure to choose the proper version of OpenShift you want to install. The main instructions for 3.11 are here and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to select a different version there, if needed:\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/index.html\nKubernetes Installation Make sure your hostname resolves to a single IP address in your /etc/hosts file. The NFS examples will not work otherwise and other problems with installation can occur unless you have a resolving hostname. You should see a single IP address returned from this command: $ hostname --ip-address  Installing Kubernetes We suggest using Kubeadm as a simple way to install Kubernetes.\nSee Kubeadm for installing the latest version of Kubeadm.\nSee Create a Cluster for creating the Kubernetes cluster using Kubeadm. Note: We find that Weave networking works particularly well with the container suite.\nPlease see here to view the official documentation regarding configuring DNS for your Kubernetes cluster.\nPost Kubernetes Configuration In order to run the various examples, Role Based Account Control will need to be set up. Specifically, the cluster-admin role will need to be assigned to the Kubernetes user that will be utilized to run the examples. This is done by creating the proper ClusterRoleBinding:\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \\ --clusterrole cluster-admin --user someuser  If you are running on GKE, the following command can be utilized to auto-populate the user option with the account that is currently logged into Google Cloud:\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \\ --clusterrole cluster-admin --user $(gcloud config get-value account)  If more than one user will be running the examples on the same Kubernetes cluster, a unique name will need to be provided for each new ClusterRoleBinding created in order to assign the cluster-admin role to every user. The example below will create a ClusterRoleBinding with a unique value:\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding \u0026lt;unique\u0026gt;-cluster-admin-binding \\ --clusterrole cluster-admin \\ --user someuser  If you are running on GKE, the following can be utilized to create a unique ClusterRoleBinding for each user, with the user’s Google Cloud account prepended to the name of each new ClusterRoleBinding:\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding \u0026quot;$(gcloud config get-value account)-cluster-admin-binding\u0026quot; \\ --clusterrole cluster-admin \\ --user $(gcloud config get-value account)  Helm Some Kubernetes Helm examples are provided in the following directory as one option for deploying the Container Suite.\n$CCPROOT/examples/helm/  Once you have your Kubernetes environment configured, it is simple to get Helm up and running. Please refer to this document to get Helm installed and configured properly.\nConfiguring Namespace and Permissions In Kubernetes, a concept called a namespace provides the means to separate created resources or components into individual logically grouped partitions. In OpenShift, namespace is referred to as a project.\nIt is considered a best practice to have dedicated namespaces for projects in both testing and production environments.\nAll examples in the Crunchy Container Suite operate within the namespace defined by the environment variable `$CCP_NAMESPACE`. The default we use for namespace is 'demo' but it can be set to any valid namespace name. The instructions below illustrate how to set up and work within new namespaces or projects in both Kubernetes and OpenShift.  Kubernetes This section will illustrate how to set up a new Kubernetes namespace called demo, and will then show how to provide permissions to that namespace to allow the Kubernetes examples to run within that namespace.\nFirst, view currently existing namespaces:\n$ kubectl get namespace NAME STATUS AGE default Active 21d kube-public Active 21d kube-system Active 21d  Then, create a new namespace called demo:\n$ kubectl create -f $CCPROOT/conf/demo-namespace.json namespace \u0026quot;demo\u0026quot; created $ kubectl get namespace demo NAME STATUS AGE demo Active 7s  Then set the namespace as the default for the current context:\nWhen a namespace is not explicitly stated for a command, Kubernetes uses the namespace specified by the currently set context.  $ kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=demo  We can verify that the namespace was set correctly through the following command:\n$ kubectl config view | grep namespace: namespace: demo  OpenShift This section assumes an administrator has already logged in first as the system:admin user as directed by the OpenShift Installation Guide.\nFor our development purposes only, we typically specify the OCP Authorization policy of AllowAll as documented here:\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/configuring_authentication.html#AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider\nWe do not recommend this authentication policy for a production deployment of OCP.\nFor the best results, it is recommended that you run the examples with a user that has **NOT** been assigned the **cluster-admin** cluster role.  Log into the system as a user:\n$ oc login -u \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;  The next step is to create a demo namespace to run the examples within. The name of this OCP project will be what you supply in the CCP_NAMESPACE environment variable:\n$ oc new-project demo --description=\u0026quot;Crunchy Containers project\u0026quot; --display-name=\u0026quot;Crunchy-Containers\u0026quot; Now using project \u0026quot;demo\u0026quot; on server \u0026quot;https://127.0.0.1:8443\u0026quot;. $ export CCP_NAMESPACE=demo  If we view the list of projects, we can see the new project has been added and is \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo;.\n$ oc get projects NAME DISPLAY NAME STATUS demo Crunchy-Containers Active myproject My Project Active  If you were on a different project and wanted to switch to the demo project, you would do so by running the following:\n$ oc project demo Now using project \u0026quot;demo\u0026quot; on server \u0026quot;https://127.0.0.1:8443\u0026quot;.  When self-provisioning a new project using the oc new-project command, the current user (i.e., the user you used when logging into OCP with the oc login command) will automatically be assigned to the admin role for that project. This will allow the user to create the majority of the objects needed to successfully run the examples. However, in order to create the Persistent Volume objects needed to properly configure storage for the examples, an additional role is needed. Specifically, a new role is needed that can both create and delete Persistent Volumes.\nUsing the following two commands, create a new Cluster Role that has the ability to create and delete persistent volumes, and then assign that role to your current user:\nPlease be aware that the following two commands require privileges that your current user may not have. In the event that you are unable to run these commands, and do not have access to a user that is able to run them (e.g., the **system:admin** user that is created by default when installing OCP), please contact your local OCP administrator to run the commands on your behalf, or grant you the access required to run them yourself.  $ oc create clusterrole crunchytester --verb=\u0026quot;list,create,delete\u0026quot; --resource=persistentvolumes clusterrole \u0026quot;crunchytester\u0026quot; created $ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user crunchytester someuser cluster role \u0026quot;crunchytester\u0026quot; added: \u0026quot;someuser\u0026quot;  Your user should now have the roles and privileges required to run the examples.\n"

	"content": " Storage Configuration Available Storage Types The Crunchy Container Suite is officially tested using two different storage backends:\n HostPath (single node testing) NFS (single and multi-node testing)  Other storage backends work as well, including GCE, EBS, ScaleIO, and others, but may require you to modify various examples or configuration.\nThe Crunchy Container Suite is tested, developed, and examples are provided that use the various storage types listed above. This ensures that customers have a high degree of choices when it comes to choosing a volume type. HostPath and NFS allow precise host path choices for where database volumes are persisted. HostPath and NFS also allow governance models where volume creation is performed by an administrator instead of the application/developer team.\nWhere customers desire a dynamic form of volume creation (e.g. self service), storage classes are also supported within the example set.\nEnvironment variables are set to determine how and what storage is to be used.\nNOTE: When running the examples using HostPath or NFS storage, the run scripts provided in the examples will create directories using the following pattern:\n$CCP_STORAGE_PATH/$CCP_NAMESPACE-\u0026lt;EXAMPLE_NAME\u0026gt; HostPath HostPath is the simplest storage backend to setup. It is only feasible on a single node but is sufficient for testing the examples. In your .bashrc file, add the following variables to specify the proper settings for your the HostPath storage volume:\nexport CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; export CCP_STORAGE_PATH=/data export CCP_STORAGE_MODE=ReadWriteMany export CCP_STORAGE_CAPACITY=400M NOTE: It may be necessary to grant your user in OpenShift or Kubernetes the rights to modify the hostaccess SCC. This can be done with the following command:\noadm policy add-scc-to-user hostaccess $(oc whoami) NFS NFS can also be utilized as a storage mechanism. Instructions for setting up a NFS can be found in the Configuration Notes for NFS section below.\nFor testing with NFS, include the following variables in your .bashrc file, providing the proper configuration details for your NFS:\nexport CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT=\u0026#39;\u0026#34;supplementalGroups\u0026#34;: [65534]\u0026#39; export CCP_STORAGE_PATH=/nfsfileshare export CCP_NFS_IP=\u0026lt;IP OF NFS SERVER\u0026gt; export CCP_STORAGE_MODE=ReadWriteMany export CCP_STORAGE_CAPACITY=400M In the example above the group ownership of the NFS mount is assumed to be nfsnobody or 65534. Additionally, it is recommended that root not be squashed on the NFS share (using no_root_squash) in order to ensure the proper directories can be created, modified and removed as needed for the various container examples.\nAdditionally, the examples in the Crunchy Container suite need access to the NFS in order to create the directories utilized by the examples. The NFS should therefore be mounted locally so that the run.sh scripts contained within the examples can complete the proper setup.\nConfiguration Notes for NFS  Most of the Crunchy containers run as the postgres UID (26), but you will notice that when supplementalGroups is specified, the pod will include the nfsnobody group in the list of groups for the pod user If you are running your NFS system with SELinux in enforcing mode, you will need to run the following command to allow NFS write permissions:\nsudo setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1  Detailed instructions for setting up a NFS server on Centos 7 can be found using the following link:   http://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-setup-nfs-server-on-centos-7-rhel-7-fedora-22.html\n If you are running your client on a VM, you will need to add insecure to the exportfs file on the NFS server due to the way port translation is done between the VM host and the VM instance. For more details on this bug, please see the following link:  http://serverfault.com/questions/107546/mount-nfs-access-denied-by-server-while-mounting\n A suggested best practice for tuning NFS for PostgreSQL is to configure the PostgreSQL fstab mount options like so:  proto=tcp,suid,rw,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,hard,fg,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 And to then change your network options as follows:\nMTU=9000  If interested in mounting the same NFS share multiple times on the same mount point, look into the noac mount option  When using NFS storage and two or more clusters share the same NFS storage directory, the clusters need to be uniquely named.  Dynamic Storage Dynamic storage classes can be used for the examples. There are various providers and solutions for dynamic storage, so please consult the Kubernetes documentation for additional details regarding supported storage choices. The environment variable CCP_STORAGE_CLASS is used in the examples to determine whether or not to create a PersistentVolume manually, or if it will be created dynamically using a StorageClass. In the case of GKE, the default StorageClass is named default. Storage class names are determined by the Kubernetes administrator and can vary.\nUsing block storage requires a security context to be set as follows:\nexport CCP_SECURITY_CONTEXT=\u0026#39;\u0026#34;fsGroup\u0026#34;:26\u0026#39; export CCP_STORAGE_CLASS=standard export CCP_STORAGE_MODE=ReadWriteOnce export CCP_STORAGE_CAPACITY=400M  "

This guide provides the instructions to get you set up to build from source.\nRequirements  CentOS 7 or Red Hat 7 environment. The instructions below are set up for CentOS 7, but you can read the installation guide for additional instructions go version 1.13+ buildah 1.14.9+ git  Setup  On your system, be sure you have installed the requirements. You can do so with the following commands:  sudo yum -y install epel-release sudo yum -y install golang git buildah  Create a fork of the Crunchy Container Suite repository and clone it to the environment using the following commands below:  mkdir -p $HOME/cdev/src/github.com/crunchydata $HOME/cdev/pkg $HOME/cdev/bin cd $HOME/cdev/src/github.com/crunchydata git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers cd crunchy-containers  Set up your local environmental variables to reference the containers you want to build. For instance, to build the latest version, you would use the following variables:  export GOPATH=$HOME/cdev # set path to your new Go workspace export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin # set bin path export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN # add Go bin path to your overall path export CCP_BASEOS=ubi8 # centos7 for CentOS, ubi8 for Red Hat Universal Base Image export CCP_PGVERSION=13 # The PostgreSQL major version export CCP_PG_FULLVERSION=13.8 export CCP_POSTGIS_VERSION=3.1 export CCP_VERSION=4.7.7 export CCP_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata # Prefix to put before all the container image names export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PG_FULLVERSION-$CCP_VERSION # Used to tag the images export CCP_POSTGIS_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PG_FULLVERSION-$CCP_POSTGIS_VERSION-$CCP_VERSION # Used to tag images that include PostGIS export CCPROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers # The base of the clone github repo You can save these variables to be set each time you open up your shell by adding them to your .bashrc file:\ncat \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc \u0026lt;\u0026lt;-EOF export GOPATH=$HOME/cdev export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN export CCP_BASEOS=ubi8 export CCP_PGVERSION=13 export CCP_PG_FULLVERSION=13.8 export CCP_POSTGIS_VERSION=3.1 export CCP_VERSION=4.7.7 export CCP_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PG_FULLVERSION-$CCP_VERSION export CCP_POSTGIS_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PG_FULLVERSION-$CCP_POSTGIS_VERSION-$CCP_VERSION export CCPROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers EOF  Download the GPG Keys and repository files that are required to pull in the packages used to build the containers:  cd $CCPROOT curl https://api.developers.crunchydata.com/downloads/repo/rpm-centos/postgresql12/crunchypg12.repo \u0026gt; conf/crunchypg12.repo curl https://api.developers.crunchydata.com/downloads/repo/rpm-centos/postgresql11/crunchypg11.repo \u0026gt; conf/crunchypg11.repo curl https://api.developers.crunchydata.com/downloads/gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-crunchydata-dev \u0026gt; conf/RPM-GPG-KEY-crunchydata-dev  Run the setup script to download the remaining dependencies  cd $CCPROOT make setup Build You can now build the containers:\ncd $CCPROOT make all if you want to build an individual container such as crunchy-postgres, you need to reference the individual name:\ncd $CCPROOT make postgres To learn how to build each container, please review the Makefile targets within the Makefile in the repository.\n"

Supports upgrades from: 9.5 to 9.6 9.6 to 10 10 to 11 11 to 12 12 to 13  Packages The crunchy-upgrade Docker image contains the following packages (versions vary depending on PostgreSQL version):\n PostgreSQL (13.8, 12.12, 11.17, and 10.22) CentOS 7, UBI 8 - publicly available UBI 7, UBI 8 - customers only  Environment Variables Required    Name Default Description     OLD_DATABASE_NAME None Refers to the database (pod) name that we want to convert.   NEW_DATABASE_NAME None Refers to the database (pod) name that is given to the upgraded database.   OLD_VERSION None The PostgreSQL version of the old database.   NEW_VERSION None The PostgreSQL version of the new database.    Optional    Name Default Description     PG_LOCALE Default locale If set, the locale you want to create the database with.   CHECKSUMS true Enables data-checksums during initialization of the database. Can only be set during initial database creation. Set to false to disable data checksums.   XLOGDIR None If set, initdb will use the specified directory for WAL.   CRUNCHY_DEBUG FALSE Set this to true to enable debugging in logs. Note: this mode can reveal secrets in logs.    Data checksums on the Crunchy PostgreSQL container were enabled by default in version 2.1.0. When trying to upgrade, it's required that both the old database and the new database have the same data checksums setting. Prior to upgrade, check if `data_checksums` were enabled on the database by running the following SQL: `SHOW data_checksums`  "
