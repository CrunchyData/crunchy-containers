      <description>The crunchy-pgpool container executes the pgPool II utility. pgPool can be used to provide a smart PostgreSQL-aware proxy to a PostgreSQL cluster, both primary and replica, so that applications only have to work with a single database connection.
PostgreSQL replicas are read-only whereas a primary is capable of receiving both read and write actions.
The default pgPool examples use a Secret to hold the set of pgPool configuration files used by the examples.</description>
