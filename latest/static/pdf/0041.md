So you decided to submit an issue and work it.  Great! Let's get it merged in to the codebase. The following will go a long way to helping get the fix merged in quicker:

1. Fork the [Github repository](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers) and make a branch off of the `master` branch
2. Create a Pull Request from your Fork back to the `master` branch.
3. Update the checklists in the Pull Request description.
4. Reference which issues this Pull Request is resolving.
