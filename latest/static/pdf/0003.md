# Overview

The following provides a high level overview of each of the container images.

## Red Hat UBI Images

The Crunchy Container suite provides OS image: `ubi8-minimal`.  The image
utilize Crunchy Certified RPM's for the installation of PostgreSQL, and outside of the base images
utilized to build the containers and any packages included within them (UBI).  The `ubi8-minimal` 
are built using the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI).

## Database Images

Crunchy Container Suite provides two types of PostgreSQL database images:

* Crunchy PostgreSQL
* Crunchy PostGIS

Supported major versions of these images are:

- 14
- 13
- 12
- 11
- 10

### Crunchy PostgreSQL

Crunchy PostgreSQL is an unmodified deployment of the PostgreSQL relational database.
It supports the following features:

* Asynchronous and synchronous replication
* Mounting custom configuration files such as `pg_hba.conf`, `postgresql.conf` and
  `setup.sql`
* Can be configured to use SSL authentication
* Logging to container logs
* Dedicated users for: administration, monitoring, connection pooler authentication,
  replication and user applications.
* pgBackRest backups built into the container
* Archiving WAL to dedicated volume mounts
* [Extensions available](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/contrib.html) in the PostgreSQL contrib module.
* Enhanced audit logging from the pgAudit extension
* Enhanced database statistics from the pg_stat_tatements extensions
* Python Procedural Language from the PL/Python extensions
* Backups
  * Logical: `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` are included as logical backup and restore tools. These can be used to export and import SQL that recreates the database
  * Physical: `pg_basebackup` is included as a physical backup tool. This can be used to backup the files that comprise the database
* Benchmarking with `pgbench`

#### Running Modes

The Crunchy PostgreSQL container can be run in modes, specified by setting the `MODE` environment variable, enabling different features. Detailed information for configuring the `crunchy-postgres` container running modes can be found in the container specification [documentation]({{< relref "/container-specifications/crunchy-postgres" >}}).

###### Backup

The `backup` mode allows users to create [pg_basebackup](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgbasebackup.html)
physical backups.  The backups created by Crunchy Backup can be mounted to the Crunchy
PostgreSQL container to restore databases.

###### pgBasebackup-restore

The `pgbasebackup-restore` mode allows users to restore from a [pg_basebackup](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgbasebackup.html)
physical backup using `rsync`.

###### pgDump

The `pgdump` mode creates a logical backup of the database using the
[pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) tool.  It
supports the following features:

* `pg_dump` individual databases
* `pg_dump` all databases
* various formats of backups: plain (SQL), custom (compressed archive), directory
  (directory with one file for each table and blob being dumped with a table of
  contents) and tar (uncompressed tar archive)
* Logical backups of database sections such as: DDL, data only, indexes, schema

###### pgRestore

The `pgrestore` mode allows users to restore a PostgreSQL database from
`pg_dump` logical backups using the [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) tool.

###### Sqlrunner

The `sqlrunner` mode uses [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) to run all of the SQL files that are provided in the `/pgconf` volume.

###### pgBench

The `pgbench` mode allows users to run benchmarking tests on PostgreSQL using [pgbench](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbench.html)


### Crunchy PostgreSQL PostGIS

The Crunchy PostgreSQL PostGIS mirrors all the features of the Crunchy PostgreSQL
image but additionally provides the following geospatial extensions:

* PostGIS
* PostGIS Topology
* PostGIS Tiger Geocoder
* FuzzyStrMatch

## Backup and Restoration Options

Crunchy Container Suite provides support for two types of backups:

* Physical - backups of the files that comprise the database
* Logical - an export of the SQL that recreates the database

*Physical* backup and restoration tools included in the Crunchy Container suite are:

* [pgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/) (2.41)
* [pg_basebackup](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgbasebackup.html) -
  provided by the Crunchy PostgreSQL image

*Logical* backup and restoration tools are:

* [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) - provided by
  the Crunchy PostgreSQL image
* [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) - provided by
  the Crunchy PostgreSQL image

### Crunchy BackRest Restore

The Crunchy BackRest Restore image restores a PostgreSQL database from pgBackRest
physical backups.  This image supports the following types of restores:

* Full - all database cluster files are restored and PostgreSQL
  replays Write Ahead Logs (WAL) to the latest point in time.  Requires an empty
  data directory.
* Delta - missing files for the database cluster are restored and PostgreSQL
  replays Write Ahead Logs (WAL) to the latest point in time.
* PITR - missing files for the database cluster are restored and PostgreSQL
  replays Write Ahead Logs (WAL) to a specific point in time.

Visit the official pgBackRest website for more information: https://pgbackrest.org/

## Administration

The following images can be used to administer and maintain Crunchy PostgreSQL
database containers.

### Crunchy pgAdmin4

The Crunchy pgAdmin4 images allows users to administer their Crunchy PostgreSQL containers
via a graphical user interface web application.

### Crunchy Upgrade

The Crunchy Upgrade image allows users to perform major upgrades of their Crunchy
PostgreSQL containers.  The following upgrade versions of PostgreSQL are available:

- 14
- 13
- 12
- 11
- 10
- 9.6
- 9.5

## Performance and Monitoring

The following images can be used to understand how Crunchy PostgreSQL containers
are performing over time using tools such as pgBadger.

### Crunchy pgBadger

The Crunchy pgBadger image provides a tool that parses PostgreSQL logs and generates
an in-depth statistical report.  Crunchy pgBadger reports include:

* Connections
* Sessions
* Checkpoints
* Vacuum
* Locks
* Queries

Additionally Crunchy pgBadger can be configured to store reports for analysis over
time.

## Connection Pooling and Logical Routers

### Crunchy pgBouncer

The Crunchy pgBouncer image provides a lightweight PostgreSQL connection pooler.
Using pgBouncer, users can lower overhead of opening new connections and control
traffic to their PostgreSQL databases.  Crunchy pgBouncer supports the following
features:

* Connection pooling
* Drain, Pause, Stop connections to Crunchy PostgreSQL containers
* Dedicated pgBouncer user for authentication queries
* Dynamic user authentication

Visit the official pgBouncer website for more information: https://pgbouncer.github.io

### Crunchy pgPool II

The Crunchy pgPool image provides a logical router and connection pooler for Crunchy
PostgreSQL containers.  pgPool examines SQL queries and redirects write queries to
the primary and read queries to replicas.  This allows users to setup a single
entrypoint for their applications without requiring knowledge of read replicas.
Additionally pgPool provides connection pooling to lower overhead of opening new
connections to Crunchy PostgreSQL containers.
