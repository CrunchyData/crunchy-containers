      <description>The documentation website is generated using Hugo.
Hosting Hugo Locally (Optional) If you would like to build the documentation locally, view the official Installing Hugo guide to set up Hugo locally.
The git submodule for the crunchy-hugo-theme has to be synched -
cd $CCPROOT/ git submodule init git submodule update You can then start the server by running the following commands -
cd $CCPROOT/docs/ hugo server The local version of the Hugo server is accessible by default from localhost:1313.</description>
