      <description>PostgreSQL Container Example This example starts a single PostgreSQL container and service, the most simple of examples.
The container creates a default database called userdb, a default user called testuser and a default password of password.
For all environments, the script additionally creates:
 A persistent volume claim A crunchy-postgres container named primary The database using predefined environment variables  And specifically for the Kubernetes and OpenShift environments:
 A pod named primary A service named primary A PVC named primary-pgdata The database using predefined environment variables  To shutdown the instance and remove the container for each example, run the following:</description>

      <description>Overview The following provides a high level overview of each of the container images.
CentOS vs Red Hat UBI Images The Crunchy Container suite provides three different OS images: centos7, ubi7, and ubi8-minimal. Both images utilize Crunchy Ceritifed RPM&amp;rsquo;s for the installation of PostgreSQL, and outside of the base images utilized to build the containers and any packages included within them (either CentOS or UBI), both are effectively the same.</description>

      <guid>https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/4.7.7/examples/postgresql/custom-config/</guid>
      <description>Custom Configuration You can use your own version of the SQL file setup.sql to customize the initialization of database data and objects when the container and database are created.
This works by placing a file named setup.sql within the /pgconf mounted volume directory. Portions of the setup.sql file are required for the container to work; please see comments within the sample setup.sql file.
If you mount a /pgconf volume, crunchy-postgres will look at that directory for postgresql.</description>

      <guid>https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/4.7.7/examples/backup-restoration/pgbasebackup/</guid>
      <description>pgBaseBackup Examples The script assumes you are going to backup the primary container created in the first example, so you need to ensure that container is running. This example assumes you have configured storage as described in the Storage Configuration documentation. Things to point out with this example include its use of persistent volumes and volume claims to store the backup data files.
A successful backup will perform pg_basebackup on the primary container and store the backup in the $CCP_STORAGE_PATH volume under a directory named $CCP_NAMESPACE-primary-backups.</description>

      <description>pgBench Example pgbench is a simple program for running benchmark tests on PostgreSQL. It runs the same sequence of SQL commands over and over, possibly in multiple concurrent database sessions, and then calculates the average transaction rate (transactions per second). By default, pgbench tests a scenario that is loosely based on TPC-B, involving five SELECT, UPDATE, and INSERT commands per transaction. However, it is easy to test other cases by writing your own transaction script files.</description>

      <guid>https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/4.7.7/examples/logging/pgaudit/</guid>
      <description>pgAudit Enhanced Logging This example provides an example of enabling pg_audit output. As of release 1.3, pg_audit is included in the crunchy-postgres container and is added to the PostgreSQL shared library list in postgresql.conf.
Given the numerous ways pg_audit can be configured, the exact pg_audit configuration is left to the user to define. pg_audit allows you to configure auditing rules either in postgresql.conf or within your SQL script.
For this test, we place pg_audit statements within a SQL script and verify that auditing is enabled and working.</description>

      <description>Major Upgrade This example assumes you have run *primary* using a PostgreSQL 12 or 13 image such as `ubi8-13.8-4.7.7` prior to running this upgrade.  The upgrade container will let you perform a pg_upgrade from a PostgreSQL version 9.5, 9.6, 10, 11, 12, or 13 database to the available any of the higher versions of PostgreSQL versions that are currently support which are 9.6, 10, 11, 12, and 13. It does not do multi-version upgrades so you will need to for example do a 10 to 11 and then a 11 to 12 to get to version 12.</description>
